Ceremonial Chemicals
--------------------

Most hackers don't smoke tobacco, and use alcohol in moderation if at
all. However, there has been something of a trend towards exotic beers
since about 1995, especially among younger Linux hackers apparently
influenced by Linus Torvalds's fondness for Guinness.

Limited use of non-addictive psychedelic drugs, such as cannabis, LSD,
psilocybin, nitrous oxide, etc., used to be relatively common and is
still regarded with more tolerance than in the mainstream culture. Use
of ‘downers’ and opiates, on the other hand, appears to be particularly
rare; hackers seem in general to dislike drugs that make them stupid.
But `*on the gripping hand* <O/on-the-gripping-hand.html>`__, many
hackers regularly wire up on caffeine and/or sugar for all-night hacking
runs.
