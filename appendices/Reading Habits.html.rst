Reading Habits

Omnivorous, but usually includes lots of science and science fiction.
The typical hacker household might subscribe to *Analog*, *Scientific
American*, *Whole-Earth Review*, and *Smithsonian* (most hackers ignore
*Wired* and other self-consciously ‘cyberpunk’ magazines, considering
them `*wannabee* <W/wannabee.html>`__ fodder). Hackers often have a
reading range that astonishes liberal arts people but tend not to talk
about it as much. Many hackers spend as much of their spare time reading
as the average American burns up watching TV, and often keep shelves and
shelves of well-thumbed books in their homes.
