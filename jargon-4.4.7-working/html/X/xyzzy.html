**xyzzy**: /X·Y·Z·Z·Y/, /X·Y·ziz´ee/, /ziz´ee/, /ik·ziz´ee/, adj.

[from the ADVENT game] The `*canonical* <../C/canonical.html>`__ ‘magic
word’. This comes from `*ADVENT* <../A/ADVENT.html>`__, in which the
idea is to explore an underground cave with many rooms and to collect
the treasures you find there. If you type xyzzy at the appropriate time,
you can move instantly between two otherwise distant points. If,
therefore, you encounter some bit of `*magic* <../M/magic.html>`__, you
might remark on this quite succinctly by saying simply “Xyzzy!”
“Ordinarily you can't look at someone else's screen if he has protected
it, but if you type quadruple-bucky-clear the system will let you do it
anyway.” “Xyzzy!” It's traditional for xyzzy to be an `*Easter
egg* <../E/Easter-egg.html>`__ in games with text interfaces.

Xyzzy has actually been implemented as an undocumented no-op command on
several OSes; in Data General's AOS/VS, for example, it would typically
respond “Nothing happens”, just as `*ADVENT* <../A/ADVENT.html>`__ did
if the magic was invoked at the wrong spot or before a player had
performed the action that enabled the word. In more recent 32-bit
versions, by the way, AOS/VS responds “Twice as much happens”.

Early versions of the popular ‘minesweeper’ game under Microsoft Windows
had a cheat mode triggered by the command ‘xyzzy<enter><right-shift>’
that turns the top-left pixel of the screen different colors depending
on whether or not the cursor is over a bomb. This feature temporarily
disappeared in Windows 98, but reappeared in Windows 2000.

The following passage from *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* by L. Frank
Baum, suggesting a possible pre-ADVENT origin, has recently come to
light: “Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!” said Dorothy, who was now standing on both
feet. This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great
chattering and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up
to them.
