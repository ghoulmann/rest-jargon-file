**TAN**: adj.

[Usenet, particularly ``rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan``] Abbrev. of
‘tangent’, as in “off on a tangent”, and synonym for
`*OT* <../O/OT.html>`__. A number of hacker-humor synonyms are used for
TAN in some newsgroups. Instances such as BEIGE, OFF-WHITE,
BROWNISH-GRAY, and LIGHT BROWN have been observed. It is generally
understood on newsgroups with this convention that any color descriptor
is a TAN synonym if (a) used as the first word(s) of the topic of a
Usenet post, (b) written in ALL CAPS, and (c) followed immediately by a
colon. Usage: “OFF-WHITE: 2000 Presidential candidates” on an SF
newsgroup.
