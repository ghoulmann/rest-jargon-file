**macdink**: /mak´dink/, vt.

[from the Apple Macintosh, which is said to encourage such behavior] To
make many incremental and unnecessary cosmetic changes to a program or
file. Often the subject of the macdinking would be better off without
them. “When I left at 11PM last night, he was still macdinking the
slides for his presentation.” See also
