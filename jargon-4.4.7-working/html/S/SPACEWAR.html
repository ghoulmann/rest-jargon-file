**SPACEWAR**: n.

A space-combat simulation game, inspired by E. E. “Doc” Smith's
*Lensman* books, in which two spaceships duel around a central sun,
shooting torpedoes at each other and jumping through hyperspace. This
game was first implemented on the PDP-1 at MIT in 1962. In 1968-69, a
descendant of the game motivated Ken Thompson to build, in his spare
time on a scavenged PDP-7, the operating system that became
`*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__. Less than nine years after that, SPACEWAR
was commercialized as one of the first video games; descendants are
still `*feep* <../F/feep.html>`__\ ing in video arcades everywhere.
