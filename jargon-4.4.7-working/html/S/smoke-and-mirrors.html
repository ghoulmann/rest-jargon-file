**smoke and mirrors**: n.

Marketing deceptions. The term is mainstream in this general sense.
Among hackers it's strongly associated with bogus demos and crocked
`*benchmark* <../B/benchmark.html>`__\ s (see also
`*MIPS* <../M/MIPS.html>`__, `*machoflops* <../M/machoflops.html>`__).
“They claim their new box cranks 50 MIPS for under $5000, but didn't
specify the instruction mix — sounds like smoke and mirrors to me.” The
phrase, popularized by newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin c.1975, has
been said to derive from carnie slang for magic acts and ‘freak show’
displays that depend on *trompe l'oeil* effects, but also calls to mind
the fierce Aztec god Tezcatlipoca (lit. “Smoking Mirror”) for whom the
hearts of huge numbers of human sacrificial victims were regularly cut
out. Upon hearing about a rigged demo or yet another round of
fantasy-based marketing promises, hackers often feel analogously
disheartened. See also `*stealth manager* <stealth-manager.html>`__.
