**software rot**: n.

Term used to describe the tendency of software that has not been used in
a while to `*lose* <../L/lose.html>`__; such failure may be
semi-humorously ascribed to `*bit rot* <../B/bit-rot.html>`__. More
commonly, software rot strikes when a program's assumptions become out
of date. If the design was insufficiently
`*robust* <../R/robust.html>`__, this may cause it to fail in mysterious
ways. Syn. code rot. See also `*link rot* <../L/link-rot.html>`__.

For example, owing to endemic shortsightedness in the design of COBOL
programs, a good number of them succumbed to software rot when their
2-digit year counters underwent `*wrap
around* <../W/wrap-around.html>`__ at the beginning of the year 2000.
Actually, related lossages often afflict centenarians who have to deal
with computer software designed by unimaginative clods. One such
incident became the focus of a minor public flap in 1990, when a
gentleman born in 1889 applied for a driver's license renewal in
Raleigh, North Carolina. The new system refused to issue the card,
probably because with 2-digit years the ages 101 and 1 cannot be
distinguished.

Historical note: Software rot in an even funnier sense than the mythical
one was a real problem on early research computers (e.g., the R1; see
`*grind crank* <../G/grind-crank.html>`__). If a program that depended
on a peculiar instruction hadn't been run in quite a while, the user
might discover that the opcodes no longer did the same things they once
did. (“Hey, so-and-so needs an instruction to do such-and-such. We can
`*snarf* <snarf.html>`__ this opcode, right? No one uses it.”) Another
classic example of this sprang from the time an MIT hacker found a
simple way to double the speed of the unconditional jump instruction on
a PDP-6, so he patched the hardware. Unfortunately, this broke some
fragile timing software in a music-playing program, throwing its output
out of tune. This was fixed by adding a defensive initialization routine
to compare the speed of a timing loop with the real-time clock; in other
words, it figured out how fast the PDP-6 was that day, and corrected
appropriately.
