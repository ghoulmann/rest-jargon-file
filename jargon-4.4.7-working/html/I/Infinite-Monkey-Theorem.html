**Infinite-Monkey Theorem**: n.

“If you put an `*infinite* <infinite.html>`__ number of monkeys at
typewriters, eventually one will bash out the script for Hamlet.” (One
may also hypothesize a small number of monkeys and a very long period of
time.) This theorem asserts nothing about the intelligence of the one
`*random* <../R/random.html>`__ monkey that eventually comes up with the
script (and note that the mob will also type out all the possible
*incorrect* versions of Hamlet). It may be referred to semi-seriously
when justifying a `*brute force* <../B/brute-force.html>`__ method; the
implication is that, with enough resources thrown at it, any technical
challenge becomes a `*one-banana
problem* <../O/one-banana-problem.html>`__. This argument gets more
respect since `*Linux* <../L/Linux.html>`__ justified the
`*bazaar* <../B/bazaar.html>`__ mode of development.

Other hackers maintain that the Infinite-Monkey Theorem cannot be true —
otherwise Usenet would have reproduced the entire canon of great
literature by now.

In mid-2002, researchers at Plymouth Univesity in England actually put a
working computer in a cage with six crested macaques. The monkeys
proceeded to bash the machine with a rock, urinate on it, and type the
letter S a lot (later, the letters A, J, L, and M also crept in). The
results were published in a limited-edition book, *Notes Towards The
Complete Works of Shakespeare*. A researcher reported: “They were quite
interested in the screen, and they saw that when they typed a letter,
something happened. There was a level of intention there.” Scattered
field reports that there are AOL users this competent have been greeted
with well-deserved skepticism.

This theorem has been traced to the mathematiciamn Émile Borel in 1913,
and was first popularized by the astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington. It
became part of the idiom of techies via the classic SF short story
`Inflexible Logic <http://www.janda.org/c10/readings/monkeys.htm>`__ by
Russell Maloney, and many younger hackers know it through a reference in
Douglas Adams's *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*. Some other
references have been `collected on the
Web <http://www.angelfire.com/in/hypnosonic/Parable_of_the_Monkeys.html>`__.
On 1 April 2000 the usage acquired its own Internet standard,
`RFC2795 <%20%20%20%20http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2795.txt>`__ (Infinite
Monkey Protocol Suite).
