**war-chalking**

[play on `*war-driving* <war-driving.html>`__; the first syllable has
since been reinterpreted as an acronym for “wireless access revolution”]
The practice of using chalk marks similar to hobo signs to indicate the
nearby presence of a wireless Internet access point, a boon to strolling
hackers with laptops. The concept was first floated in early 2002 and
was instantly seized upon with cries of glee by hackers all over the
portions of the world urbanized enough to have sidewalks and access
points. The process rather recalls the explosive spread of heraldry in
the medieval Europe of the 1120s. There is a site that `explains the
symbology <http://www.warchalking.org/>`__;.
