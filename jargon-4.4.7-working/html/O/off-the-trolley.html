**off the trolley**: adj.

Describes the behavior of a program that malfunctions and goes
catatonic, but doesn't actually `*crash* <../C/crash.html>`__ or abort.
See `*glitch* <../G/glitch.html>`__, `*bug* <../B/bug.html>`__, `*deep
space* <../D/deep-space.html>`__, `*wedged* <../W/wedged.html>`__.

This term is much older than computing, and is (uncommon) slang
elsewhere. A trolley is the small wheel that trolls, or runs against,
the heavy wire that carries the current to run a streetcar. It's at the
end of the long pole (the trolley pole) that reaches from the roof of
the streetcar to the overhead line. When the trolley stops making
contact with the wire (from passing through a switch, going over bumpy
track, or whatever), the streetcar comes to a halt, (usually) without
crashing. The streetcar is then said to be off the trolley, or off the
wire. Later on, trolley came to mean the streetcar itself. Since
streetcars became common in the 1890s, the term is more than 100 years
old. Nowadays, trolleys are only seen on historic streetcars, since
modern streetcars use pantographs to contact the wire.
