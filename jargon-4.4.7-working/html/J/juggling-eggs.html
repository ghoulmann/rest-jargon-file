**juggling eggs**: vi.

Keeping a lot of `*state* <../S/state.html>`__ in your head while
modifying a program. “Don't bother me now, I'm juggling eggs”, means
that an interrupt is likely to result in the program's being scrambled.
In the classic 1975 first-contact SF novel *The Mote in God's Eye*, by
Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, an alien describes a very difficult
task by saying “We juggle priceless eggs in variable gravity.” It is
possible that this was intended as tribute to a less colorful use of the
same image in Robert Heinlein's influential 1961 novel *Stranger in a
Strange Land*. See also `*hack mode* <../H/hack-mode.html>`__ and `*on
the gripping hand* <../O/on-the-gripping-hand.html>`__.
