**barf**: /barf/, n.,v.

[common; from mainstream slang meaning ‘vomit’]

1. interj. Term of disgust. This is the closest hackish equivalent of
the Valspeak “gag me with a spoon”. (Like, euwww!) See
`*bletch* <bletch.html>`__.

2. vi. To say “Barf!” or emit some similar expression of disgust. “I
showed him my latest hack and he barfed” means only that he complained
about it, not that he literally vomited.

3. vi. To fail to work because of unacceptable input, perhaps with a
suitable error message, perhaps not. Examples: “The division operation
barfs if you try to divide by 0.” (That is, the division operation
checks for an attempt to divide by zero, and if one is encountered it
causes the operation to fail in some unspecified, but generally obvious,
manner.) “The text editor barfs if you try to read in a new file before
writing out the old one.”

See `*choke* <../C/choke.html>`__. In Commonwealth Hackish, barf is
generally replaced by ‘puke’ or ‘vom’. `*barf* <barf.html>`__ is
sometimes also used as a `*metasyntactic
variable* <../M/metasyntactic-variable.html>`__, like
`*foo* <../F/foo.html>`__ or `*bar* <bar.html>`__.
