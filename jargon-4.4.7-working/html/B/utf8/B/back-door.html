**back door**: n.

[common] A hole in the security of a system deliberately left in place
by designers or maintainers. The motivation for such holes is not always
sinister; some operating systems, for example, come out of the box with
privileged accounts intended for use by field service technicians or the
vendor's maintenance programmers. Syn. `*trap
door* <../T/trap-door.html>`__; may also be called a wormhole. See also
`*iron box* <../I/iron-box.html>`__, `*cracker* <../C/cracker.html>`__,
`*worm* <../W/worm.html>`__, `*logic bomb* <../L/logic-bomb.html>`__.

Historically, back doors have often lurked in systems longer than anyone
expected or planned, and a few have become widely known. Ken Thompson's
1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM admitted the existence of a back
door in early Unix versions that may have qualified as the most
fiendishly clever security hack of all time. In this scheme, the C
compiler contained code that would recognize when the login command was
being recompiled and insert some code recognizing a password chosen by
Thompson, giving him entry to the system whether or not an account had
been created for him.

Normally such a back door could be removed by removing it from the
source code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler. But to
recompile the compiler, you have to *use* the compiler — so Thompson
also arranged that the compiler would *recognize when it was compiling a
version of itself*, and insert into the recompiled compiler the code to
insert into the recompiled login the code to allow Thompson entry — and,
of course, the code to recognize itself and do the whole thing again the
next time around! And having done this once, he was then able to
recompile the compiler from the original sources; the hack perpetuated
itself invisibly, leaving the back door in place and active but with no
trace in the sources.

The Turing lecture that reported this truly moby hack was later
published as “Reflections on Trusting Trust”, *Communications of the ACM
27*, 8 (August 1984), pp. 761--763 (text available at
`http://www.acm.org/classics/ <http://www.acm.org/classics/sep95/>`__).
Ken Thompson has since confirmed that this hack was implemented and that
the Trojan Horse code did appear in the login binary of a Unix Support
group machine. Ken says the crocked compiler was never distributed. Your
editor has heard two separate reports that suggest that the crocked
login did make it out of Bell Labs, notably to BBN, and that it enabled
at least one late-night login across the network by someone using the
login name “kt”.
