**broken arrow**: n.

[IBM] The error code displayed on line 25 of a 3270 terminal (or a PC
emulating a 3270) for various kinds of protocol violations and
“unexpected” error conditions (including connection to a
`*down* <../D/down.html>`__ computer). On a PC, simulated with ‘->/\_’,
with the two center characters overstruck.

Note: to appreciate this term fully, it helps to know that “broken
arrow” is also military jargon for an accident involving nuclear
weapons....
