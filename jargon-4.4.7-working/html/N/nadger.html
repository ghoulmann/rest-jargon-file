**nadger**: /nad´jr/, v.

[UK, from rude slang noun nadgers for testicles; compare American &
British bollixed] Of software or hardware (not people), to twiddle some
object in a hidden manner, generally so that it conforms better to some
format. For instance, string printing routines on 8-bit processors often
take the string text from the instruction stream, thus a print call
looks like **jsr print:"Hello world"**. The print routine has to nadger
the saved instruction pointer so that the processor doesn't try to
execute the text as instructions when the subroutine returns. See
`*adger* <../A/adger.html>`__.
