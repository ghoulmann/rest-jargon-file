<h1>Email Quotes and Inclusion Conventions<a class="headerlink" href="#email-quotes-and-inclusion-conventions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>One area where conventions for on-line writing are still in some flux is
the marking of included material from earlier messages — what would be
called ‘block quotations’ in ordinary English. From the usual
typographic convention employed for these (smaller font at an extra
indent), there derived a practice of included text being indented by one
ASCII TAB (0001001) character, which under Unix and many other
environments gives the appearance of an 8-space indent.</p>
<p>Early mail and netnews readers had no facility for including messages
this way, so people had to paste in copy manually. BSD Mail(1) was the
first message agent to support inclusion, and early Usenetters emulated
its style. But the TAB character tended to push included text too far to
the right (especially in multiply nested inclusions), leading to ugly
wraparounds. After a brief period of confusion (during which an
inclusion leader consisting of three or four spaces became established
in EMACS and a few mailers), the use of leading <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">``</span> <span class="pre">became</span>
<span class="pre">standard,</span> <span class="pre">perhaps</span> <span class="pre">owing</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">its</span> <span class="pre">use</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">ed(1)</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">display</span> <span class="pre">tabs</span>
<span class="pre">(alternatively,</span> <span class="pre">it</span> <span class="pre">may</span> <span class="pre">derive</span> <span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">``&gt;</span></tt> that some early Unix
mailers used to quote lines starting with &#8220;From&#8221; in text, so they
wouldn&#8217;t look like the beginnings of new message headers). Inclusions
within inclusions keep their <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></tt> leaders, so the ‘nesting level&#8217; of a
quotation is visually apparent.</p>
<p>The practice of including text from the parent article when posting a
followup helped solve what had been a major nuisance on Usenet: the fact
that articles do not arrive at different sites in the same order.
Careless posters used to post articles that would begin with, or even
consist entirely of, “No, that&#8217;s wrong” or “I agree” or the like. It was
hard to see who was responding to what. Consequently, around 1984, new
news-posting software evolved a facility to automatically include the
text of a previous article, marked with “&gt; ” or whatever the poster
chose. The poster was expected to delete all but the relevant lines. The
result has been that, now, careless posters post articles containing the
<em>entire</em> text of a preceding article, <em>followed</em> only by “No, that&#8217;s
wrong” or “I agree”.</p>
<p>Many people feel that this cure is worse than the original disease, and
there soon appeared newsreader software designed to let the reader skip
over included text if desired. Today, some posting software rejects
articles containing too high a proportion of lines beginning with ‘&gt;&#8217; —
but this too has led to undesirable workarounds, such as the deliberate
inclusion of zero-content filler lines which aren&#8217;t quoted and thus pull
the message below the rejection threshold.</p>
<p>Inclusion practice is still evolving, and disputes over the ‘correct’
inclusion style occasionally lead to <a class="reference external" href="H/holy-wars.html">holy wars</a>.</p>
<p>Most netters view an inclusion as a promise that comment on it will
immediately follow. The preferred, conversational style looks like this,</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&gt; relevant excerpt 1</div>
<div class="line">response to excerpt</div>
<div class="line">&gt; relevant excerpt 2</div>
<div class="line">response to excerpt</div>
<div class="line">&gt; relevant excerpt 3</div>
<div class="line">response to excerpt</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>or for short messages like this:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&gt; entire message</div>
<div class="line">response to message</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thanks to poor design of some PC-based mail agents (notably Microsoft
Outlook and Outlook Express), one will occasionally see the entire
quoted message <em>after</em> the response, like this</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">response to message</div>
<div class="line">&gt; entire message</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>but this practice is strongly deprecated.</p>
<p>Though <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></tt> remains the standard inclusion leader, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">|</span></tt> is
occasionally used for extended quotations where original variations in
indentation are being retained (one mailer even combines these and uses
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">|&gt;</span></tt>). One also sees different styles of quoting a number of authors
in the same message: one (deprecated because it loses information) uses
a leader of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">``</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">everyone,</span> <span class="pre">another</span> <span class="pre">(the</span> <span class="pre">most</span> <span class="pre">common)</span> <span class="pre">is</span>
<span class="pre">``&gt;</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">``,</span> <span class="pre">etc.</span> <span class="pre">(or</span> <span class="pre">``&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="pre">``,</span> <span class="pre">``&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></tt>, etc., depending on
line length and nesting depth) reflecting the original order of
messages, and yet another is to use a different citation leader for each
author, say <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">``,</span> <span class="pre">``:</span> <span class="pre">``,</span> <span class="pre">``|</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&#64;</span></tt> (preserving nesting so that the
inclusion order of messages is still apparent, or tagging the inclusions
with authors&#8217; names). Yet <em>another</em> style is to use each poster&#8217;s
initials (or login name) as a citation leader for that poster.</p>
<p>Occasionally one sees a <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">``</span></a># `` leader used for quotations from
authoritative sources such as standards documents; the intended allusion
is to the root prompt (the special Unix command prompt issued when one
is running as the privileged super-user).</p>
