**hack attack**: n.

[poss. by analogy with ‘Big Mac Attack’ from ads for the McDonald's
fast-food chain; the variant big hack attack is reported] Nearly
synonymous with `*hacking run* <hacking-run.html>`__, though the latter
more strongly implies an all-nighter.

hacked off

`Prev <hack-value.html>`__

 `Next <hacked-up.html>`__

--------------

**hacked off**: adj.

[analogous to ‘pissed off’] Said of system administrators who have
become annoyed, upset, or touchy owing to suspicions that their sites
have been or are going to be victimized by crackers, or used for
inappropriate, technically illegal, or even overtly criminal activities.
For example, having unreadable files in your home directory called
‘worm’, ‘lockpick’, or ‘goroot’ would probably be an effective (as well
as impressively obvious and stupid) way to get your sysadmin hacked off
at you.

It has been pointed out that there is precedent for this usage in U.S.
Navy slang, in which officers under discipline are sometimes said to be
“in hack” and one may speak of “hacking off the C.O.”.

Sufficiently patched, kluged, and tweaked that the surgical scars are
beginning to crowd out normal tissue (compare `*critical

become hacked up; if modifications are done with some eye to coherence
and continued maintainability, the software may emerge better for the
experience. Contrast `*hack up* <hack-up.html>`__.

hacker ethic

`Prev <hacker.html>`__ 

H

 `Next <hacker-humor.html>`__

--------------

**hacker ethic**: n.

1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and
that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by
writing open-source code and facilitating access to information and to
computing resources wherever possible.

2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically
OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of
confidentiality.

Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no means
universally, accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe to the
hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and giving away
open-source software. A few go further and assert that *all* information
should be free and *any* proprietary control of it is bad; this is the
philosophy behind the `*GNU* <../G/GNU.html>`__ project.

Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of cracking
itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering. But the belief that
‘ethical’ cracking excludes destruction at least moderates the behavior
of people who see themselves as ‘benign’ crackers (see also
`*samurai* <../S/samurai.html>`__, `*gray hat* <../G/gray-hat.html>`__).
On this view, it may be one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to
(a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop, preferably
by email from a `*superuser* <../S/superuser.html>`__ account, exactly
how it was done and how the hole can be plugged — acting as an unpaid
(and unsolicited) `*tiger team* <../T/tiger-team.html>`__.

The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic is
that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks,
software, and (where possible) computing resources with other hackers.
Huge cooperative networks such as `*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__,
`*FidoNet* <../F/FidoNet.html>`__ and the Internet itself can function
without central control because of this trait; they both rely on and
reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom's most valuable
intangible asset.

hacker

**hacker**: n.

[originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe]

1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and
how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer
to learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the *Internet Users'
Glossary*, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having
an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system,
computers and computer networks in particular.

2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys
programming rather than just theorizing about programming.

3. A person capable of appreciating `*hack value* <hack-value.html>`__.

4. A person who is good at programming quickly.

5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work
using it or on it; as in ‘a Unix hacker’. (Definitions 1 through 5 are
correlated, and people who fit them congregate.)

6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy
hacker, for example.

7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or
circumventing limitations.

8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive
information by poking around. Hence password hacker, network hacker. The
correct term for this sense is `*cracker* <../C/cracker.html>`__.

The term ‘hacker’ also tends to connote membership in the global
community defined by the net (see `*the
network* <../T/the-network.html>`__. For discussion of some of the
basics of this culture, see the `How To Become A
Hacker <http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html>`__ FAQ. It also
implies that the person described is seen to subscribe to some version
of the hacker ethic (see `*hacker ethic* <hacker-ethic.html>`__).

It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe
oneself that way. Hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a
meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are
gladly welcome. There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in
identifying yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one and are
not, you'll quickly be labeled `*bogus* <../B/bogus.html>`__). See also
`*geek* <../G/geek.html>`__, `*wannabee* <../W/wannabee.html>`__.

This term seems to have been first adopted as a badge in the 1960s by
the hacker culture surrounding TMRC and the MIT AI Lab. We have a report
that it was used in a sense close to this entry's by teenage radio hams
and electronics tinkerers in the mid-1950s.

hacker humor

`Prev <hacker-ethic.html>`__

 `Next <Hackers-the-movie.html>`__

--------------

**hacker humor**

A distinctive style of shared intellectual humor found among hackers,
having the following marked characteristics:

1. Fascination with form-vs.-content jokes, paradoxes, and humor having
to do with confusion of metalevels (see `*meta* <../M/meta.html>`__).
One way to make a hacker laugh: hold a red index card in front of
him/her with “GREEN” written on it, or vice-versa (note, however, that
this is funny only the first time).

2. Elaborate deadpan parodies of large intellectual constructs, such as
specifications (see `*write-only
memory* <../W/write-only-memory.html>`__), standards documents, language
descriptions (see `*INTERCAL* <../I/INTERCAL.html>`__), and even entire
scientific theories (see `*quantum
bogodynamics* <../Q/quantum-bogodynamics.html>`__,
`*computron* <../C/computron.html>`__).

3. Jokes that involve screwily precise reasoning from bizarre,
ludicrous, or just grossly counter-intuitive premises.

4. Fascination with puns and wordplay.

5. A fondness for apparently mindless humor with subversive currents of
intelligence in it — for example, old Warner Brothers and Rocky &
Bullwinkle cartoons, the Marx brothers, the early B-52s, and Monty
Python's Flying Circus. Humor that combines this trait with elements of
high camp and slapstick is especially favored.

6. References to the symbol-object antinomies and associated ideas in
Zen Buddhism and (less often) Taoism. See `*has the X
nature* <has-the-X-nature.html>`__,
`*Discordianism* <../D/Discordianism.html>`__,
`*zen* <../Z/zen.html>`__, `*ha ha only
serious* <ha-ha-only-serious.html>`__, `*koan* <../K/koan.html>`__.

See also `*filk* <../F/filk.html>`__,
`*retrocomputing* <../R/retrocomputing.html>`__, and the Portrait of J.
Random Hacker in `Appendix B <../appendixb.html>`__. If you have an
itchy feeling that all six of these traits are really aspects of one
thing that is incredibly difficult to talk about exactly, you are (a)
correct and (b) responding like a hacker. These traits are also
recognizable (though in a less marked form) throughout `*science-fiction
fandom* <../S/science-fiction-fandom.html>`__.

**hack**

[very common]

1. n. Originally, a quick job that produces what is needed, but not
well.

2. n. An incredibly good, and perhaps very time-consuming, piece of work
that produces exactly what is needed.

3. vt. To bear emotionally or physically. “I can't hack this heat!”

4. vt. To work on something (typically a program). In an immediate
sense: “What are you doing?” “I'm hacking TECO.” In a general
(time-extended) sense: “What do you do around here?” “I hack TECO.” More
generally, “I hack foo” is roughly equivalent to “foo is my major
interest (or project)”. “I hack solid-state physics.” See `*Hacking X
for Y* <Hacking-X-for-Y.html>`__.

5. vt. To pull a prank on. See sense 2 and `*hacker* <hacker.html>`__
(sense 5).

6. vi. To interact with a computer in a playful and exploratory rather
than goal-directed way. “Whatcha up to?” “Oh, just hacking.”

7. n. Short for `*hacker* <hacker.html>`__.

8. See `*nethack* <../N/nethack.html>`__.

9. [MIT] v. To explore the basements, roof ledges, and steam tunnels of
a large, institutional building, to the dismay of Physical Plant workers
and (since this is usually performed at educational institutions) the
Campus Police. This activity has been found to be eerily similar to
playing adventure games such as Dungeons and Dragons and
`*Zork* <../Z/Zork.html>`__. See also `*vadding* <../V/vadding.html>`__.

Constructions on this term abound. They include happy hacking (a
farewell), how's hacking? (a friendly greeting among hackers) and hack,
hack (a fairly content-free but friendly comment, often used as a
temporary farewell). For more on this totipotent term see *`The Meaning
of Hack <../meaning-of-hack.html>`__*. See also `*neat

[ITS] Ritual phrasing of part of the information which ITS made publicly

description of the form “Hacking X for Y” (e.g., “Hacking perceptrons

hack mode

`Prev <hack-attack.html>`__ 

H

--------------

**hack mode**: n.

1. What one is in when hacking, of course.

2. More specifically, a Zen-like state of total focus on The Problem
that may be achieved when one is hacking (this is why every good hacker
is part mystic). Ability to enter such concentration at will correlates
strongly with wizardliness; it is one of the most important skills
learned during `*larval stage* <../L/larval-stage.html>`__. Sometimes
amplified as deep hack mode.

Being yanked out of hack mode (see `*priority
interrupt* <../P/priority-interrupt.html>`__) may be experienced as a
physical shock, and the sensation of being in hack mode is more than a
little habituating. The intensity of this experience is probably by
itself sufficient explanation for the existence of hackers, and explains
why many resist being promoted out of positions where they can code. See
also `*cyberspace* <../C/cyberspace.html>`__ (sense 3).

Some aspects of hacker etiquette will appear quite odd to an observer
unaware of the high value placed on hack mode. For example, if someone
appears at your door, it is perfectly okay to hold up a hand (without
turning one's eyes away from the screen) to avoid being interrupted. One
may read, type, and interact with the computer for quite some time
before further acknowledging the other's presence (of course, he or she
is reciprocally free to leave without a word). The understanding is that
you might be in `*hack mode* <hack-mode.html>`__ with a lot of delicate
`*state* <../S/state.html>`__ (sense 2) in your head, and you dare not
`*swap* <../S/swap.html>`__ that context out until you have reached a
good point to pause. See also `*juggling
eggs* <../J/juggling-eggs.html>`__.

Often adduced as the reason or motivation for expending effort toward a

hack* <../D/display-hack.html>`__ for one method of computing hack
value, but this cannot really be explained, only experienced. As Louis
Armstrong once said when asked to explain jazz: “Man, if you gotta ask
you'll never know.” (Feminists please note Fats Waller's explanation of
rhythm: “Lady, if you got to ask, you ain't got it.”)

**ha ha only serious**

[from SF fandom, orig. as mutation of HHOK, ‘Ha Ha Only Kidding’] A
phrase (often seen abbreviated as HHOS) that aptly captures the flavor
of much hacker discourse. Applied especially to parodies, absurdities,
and ironic jokes that are both intended and perceived to contain a
possibly disquieting amount of truth, or truths that are constructed on
in-joke and self-parody. This lexicon contains many examples of
ha-ha-only-serious in both form and content. Indeed, the entirety of
hacker culture is often perceived as ha-ha-only-serious by hackers
themselves; to take it either too lightly or too seriously marks a
person as an outsider, a `*wannabee* <../W/wannabee.html>`__, or in
`*larval stage* <../L/larval-stage.html>`__. For further enlightenment

1. [Fidonet] A large batch of messages that a store-and-forward network
is failing to forward when it should. Often used in the phrase “Fido
coughed up a hairball today”, meaning that the stuck messages have just
come unstuck, producing a flood of mail where there had previously been
drought.

2. An unmanageably huge mass of source code. “JWZ thought the Mozilla
effort bogged down because the code was a huge hairball.”

3. Any large amount of garbage coming out suddenly. “Sendmail is
coughing up a hairball, so expect some slowness accessing the Internet.”

**hair**: n.

[back-formation from `*hairy* <hairy.html>`__] The complications that
make something hairy. “Decoding `*TECO* <../T/TECO.html>`__ commands
requires a certain amount of hair.” Often seen in the phrase infinite
hair, which connotes extreme complexity. Also in hairiferous (tending to
promote hair growth): “GNUMACS elisp encourages lusers to write complex
editing modes.” “Yeah, it's pretty hairiferous all right.” (or just:
“Hair squared!”)

**hairy**: adj.

1. Annoyingly complicated. “\ `*DWIM* <../D/DWIM.html>`__ is incredibly
hairy.”

2. Incomprehensible. “\ `*DWIM* <../D/DWIM.html>`__ is incredibly
hairy.”

3. Of people, high-powered, authoritative, rare, expert, and/or
incomprehensible. Hard to explain except in context: “He knows this
hairy lawyer who says there's nothing to worry about.” See also
`*hirsute* <hirsute.html>`__.

There is a theorem in simplicial homology theory which states that any
continuous tangent field on a 2-sphere is null at least in a point.
Mathematically literate hackers tend to associate the term ‘hairy’ with
the informal version of this theorem; “You can't comb a hairy ball
smooth.” (Previous versions of this entry associating the above informal
statement with the Brouwer fixed-point theorem were incorrect.)

The adjective ‘long-haired’ is well-attested to have been in slang use
among scientists and engineers during the early 1950s; it was equivalent
to modern hairy senses 1 and 2, and was very likely ancestral to the
hackish use. In fact the noun ‘long-hair’ was at the time used to
describe a person satisfying sense 3. Both senses probably passed out of
use when long hair was adopted as a signature trait by the 1960s
counterculture, leaving hackish hairy as a sort of stunted mutant relic.

In British mainstream use, “hairy” means “dangerous”, and consequently,
in British programming terms, “hairy” may be used to denote complicated
and/or incomprehensible code, but only if that complexity or
incomprehesiveness is also considered dangerous.

HAKMEM

**HAKMEM**: /hak´mem/, n.

MIT AI Memo 239 (February 1972). A legendary collection of neat
mathematical and programming hacks contributed by many people at MIT and
elsewhere. (The title of the memo really is “HAKMEM”, which is a
6-letterism for ‘hacks memo’.) Some of them are very useful techniques,
powerful theorems, or interesting unsolved problems, but most fall into
the category of mathematical and computer trivia. Here is a sampling of
the entries (with authors), slightly paraphrased:

Item 41 (Gene Salamin): There are exactly 23,000 prime numbers less than
``218``.

Item 46 (Rich Schroeppel): The most *probable* suit distribution in
bridge hands is 4-4-3-2, as compared to 4-3-3-3, which is the most
*evenly* distributed. This is because the world likes to have unequal
numbers: a thermodynamic effect saying things will not be in the state
of lowest energy, but in the state of lowest disordered energy.

Item 81 (Rich Schroeppel): Count the magic squares of order 5 (that is,
all the 5-by-5 arrangements of the numbers from 1 to 25 such that all
rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same number). There are about
320 million, not counting those that differ only by rotation and
reflection.

Item 154 (Bill Gosper): The myth that any given programming language is
machine independent is easily exploded by computing the sum of powers of
2. If the result loops with period ``= 1`` with sign ``+``, you are on a
sign-magnitude machine. If the result loops with period ``=    1`` at
``-1``, you are on a twos-complement machine. If the result loops with
period greater than 1, including the beginning, you are on a
ones-complement machine. If the result loops with period greater than 1,
not including the beginning, your machine isn't binary — the pattern
should tell you the base. If you run out of memory, you are on a string
or bignum system. If arithmetic overflow is a fatal error, some fascist
pig with a read-only mind is trying to enforce machine independence. But
the very ability to trap overflow is machine dependent. By this
strategy, consider the universe, or, more precisely, algebra: Let
``X =`` the sum of many powers of 2 = ...111111 (base 2). Now add ``X``
to itself: ``X + X    =`` ...111110. Thus, ``2X = X -    1``, so
``X = -1``. Therefore algebra is run on a machine (the universe) that is
two's-complement.

Item 174 (Bill Gosper and Stuart Nelson): 21963283741 is the only number
such that if you represent it on the `*PDP-10* <../P/PDP-10.html>`__ as
both an integer and a floating-point number, the bit patterns of the two
representations are identical.

Item 176 (Gosper): The “banana phenomenon” was encountered when
processing a character string by taking the last 3 letters typed out,
searching for a random occurrence of that sequence in the text, taking
the letter following that occurrence, typing it out, and iterating. This
ensures that every 4-letter string output occurs in the original. The
program typed BANANANANANANANA.... We note an ambiguity in the phrase,
“the ``N``\ th occurrence of.” In one sense, there are five 00's in
0000000000; in another, there are nine. The editing program TECO finds
five. Thus it finds only the first ANA in BANANA, and is thus obligated
to type N next. By Murphy's Law, there is but one NAN, thus forcing A,
and thus a loop. An option to find overlapped instances would be useful,
although it would require backing up ``N`` − 1 characters before seeking
the next ``N``-character string.

Note: This last item refers to a `*Dissociated
Press* <../D/Dissociated-Press.html>`__ implementation. See also
`*banana problem* <../B/banana-problem.html>`__.

HAKMEM also contains some rather more complicated mathematical and
technical items, but these examples show some of its fun flavor.

**hakspek**: /hak´speek/, n.

A shorthand method of spelling found on many British academic bulletin
boards and `*talker system* <../T/talker-system.html>`__\ s. Syllables
and whole words in a sentence are replaced by single ASCII characters
the names of which are phonetically similar or equivalent, while
multiple letters are usually dropped. Hence, ‘for’ becomes ‘4’; ‘two’,
‘too’, and ‘to’ become ‘2’; ‘ck’ becomes ‘k’. “Before I see you
tomorrow” becomes “b4 i c u 2moro”. First appeared in London about 1986,
and was probably caused by the slowness of available talker systems,
which operated on archaic machines with outdated operating systems and
no standard methods of communication.

Hakspek almost disappeared after the great bandwidth explosion of the
early 1990s, as fast Internet links wiped out the old-style talker
systems. However, it has enjoyed a revival in another medium — the Short
Message Service (SMS) associated with GSM cellphones. SMS sends are
limited to a maximum of 160 characters, and typing on a cellphone keypad
is difficult and slow anyway. There are now even published paper
dictionaries for SMS users to help them do hakspek-to-English and
vice-versa.

2. A `*magic cookie* <../M/magic-cookie.html>`__, often in the form of a
numeric index into some array somewhere, through which you can
manipulate an object like a file or window. The form file handle is
especially common.

3. [Mac] A pointer to a pointer to dynamically-allocated memory; the
extra level of indirection allows on-the-fly memory compaction (to cut
down on fragmentation) or aging out of unused resources, with minimal
impact on the (possibly multiple) parts of the larger program containing
references to the allocated memory. Compare `*snap* <../S/snap.html>`__

**handwave**: /hand´wayv/

[poss. from gestures characteristic of stage magicians]

1. v. To gloss over a complex point; to distract a listener; to support
a (possibly actually valid) point with blatantly faulty logic.

2. n. The act of handwaving. “Boy, what a handwave!”

If someone starts a sentence with “Clearly...” or “Obviously...” or “It
is self-evident that...”, it is a good bet he is about to handwave
(alternatively, use of these constructions in a sarcastic tone before a
paraphrase of someone else's argument suggests that it is a handwave).
The theory behind this term is that if you wave your hands at the right
moment, the listener may be sufficiently distracted to not notice that
what you have said is `*bogus* <../B/bogus.html>`__. Failing that, if a
listener does object, you might try to dismiss the objection with a wave
of your hand.

The use of this word is often accompanied by gestures: both hands up,
palms forward, swinging the hands in a vertical plane pivoting at the
elbows and/or shoulders (depending on the magnitude of the handwave);
alternatively, holding the forearms in one position while rotating the
hands at the wrist to make them flutter. In context, the gestures alone
can suffice as a remark; if a speaker makes an outrageously unsupported
assumption, you might simply wave your hands in this way, as an
accusation, far more eloquent than words could express, that his logic
is faulty.

2. To wait for some event to occur; to hang around until something

3. To attach a peripheral device, esp. in the construction ‘hang off’:
“We're going to hang another tape drive off the file server.” Implies a
device attached with cables, rather than something that is strictly
inside the machine's chassis.

--------------

**Hanlon's Razor**: prov.

A corollary of `*Finagle's Law* <../F/Finagles-Law.html>`__, similar to
Occam's Razor, that reads “Never attribute to malice that which can be
adequately explained by stupidity.” Quoted here because it seems to be a
particular favorite of hackers, often showing up in `*sig
block* <../S/sig-block.html>`__\ s, `*fortune
cookie* <../F/fortune-cookie.html>`__ files and the login banners of BBS
systems and commercial networks. This probably reflects the hacker's
daily experience of environments created by well-intentioned but
short-sighted people. Compare `*Sturgeon's
Law* <../S/Sturgeons-Law.html>`__, `*Ninety-Ninety
Rule* <../N/Ninety-Ninety-Rule.html>`__.

At
`http://www.statusq.org/2001/11/26.html <http://www.statusq.org/2001/11/26.html>`__
it is claimed that Hanlon's Razor was coined by one Robert J. Hanlon of
Scranton, PA. However, a curiously similar remark (“You have attributed
conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity.”) appears in
*Logic of Empire*, a classic 1941 SF story by Robert A. Heinlein, who
calls the error it indicates the ‘devil theory’ of sociology. Similar
epigrams have been attributed to William James and (on dubious evidence)
Napoleon Bonaparte.

--------------

**happily**: adv.

Of software, used to emphasize that a program is unaware of some
important fact about its environment, either because it has been fooled
into believing a lie, or because it doesn't care. The sense of ‘happy’
here is not that of elation, but rather that of blissful ignorance. “The
program continues to run, happily unaware that its output is going to
/dev/null.” Also used to suggest that a program or device would really
rather be doing something destructive, and is being given an opportunity
to do so. “If you enter an O here instead of a zero, the program will
happily erase all your data.” Nevertheless, use of this term implies a
basically benign attitude towards the program: It didn't mean any harm,
it was just eager to do its job. We'd like to be angry at it but we
shouldn't, we should try to understand it instead. The adjective
“cheerfully” is often used in exactly the same way.

**hardcoded**: adj.

1. [common] Said of data inserted directly into a program, where it
cannot be easily modified, as opposed to data in some
`*profile* <../P/profile.html>`__, resource (see
`*de-rezz* <../D/de-rezz.html>`__ sense 2), or environment variable that
a `*user* <../U/user.html>`__ or hacker can easily modify.

2. In C, this is esp. applied to use of a literal instead of a
**#define** macro (see `*magic number* <../M/magic-number.html>`__).

**hash bucket**: n.

A notional receptacle, a set of which might be used to apportion data
items for sorting or lookup purposes. When you look up a name in the
phone book (for example), you typically hash it by extracting its first
letter; the hash buckets are the alphabetically ordered letter sections.
This term is used as techspeak with respect to code that uses actual
hash functions; in jargon, it is used for human associative memory as
well. Thus, two things ‘in the same hash bucket’ are more difficult to
discriminate, and may be confused. “If you hash English words only by
length, you get too many common grammar words in the first couple of
hash buckets.” Compare `*hash collision* <hash-collision.html>`__.

[from the techspeak] (var.: hash clash) When used of people, signifies a

one (see `*thinko* <../T/thinko.html>`__). True story: One of us [ESR]
was once on the phone with a friend about to move out to Berkeley. When

heatseeker was someone who, owning a 286 PC and Windows 3.0, went out
and bought Windows 3.1 (which offers no worthwhile benefits unless you
have a 386). If all customers were heatseekers, vast amounts of money
could be made by just fixing some of the bugs in each release (n) and
selling it to them as release (n+1). Microsoft in fact seems to have
mastered this technique.

hexadecimal

H

--------------

**hexadecimal**: n.

Base 16. Coined in the early 1950s to replace earlier sexadecimal, which
was too racy and amusing for stuffy IBM, and later adopted by the rest
of the industry.

Actually, neither term is etymologically pure. If we take binary to be
paradigmatic, the most etymologically correct term for base 10, for
example, is ‘denary’, which comes from ‘deni’ (ten at a time, ten each),
a Latin distributive number; the corresponding term for base-16 would be
something like ‘sendenary’. “Decimal” comes from the combining root of
decem, Latin for 10. If wish to create a truly analogous word for base
16, we should start with sedecim, Latin for 16. Ergo, sedecimal is the
word that would have been created by a Latin scholar. The ‘sexa-’ prefix
is Latin but incorrect in this context, and *‘hexa-*\ ’ is Greek. The
word octal is similarly incorrect; a correct form would be ‘octaval’ (to
go with decimal), or ‘octonary’ (to go with binary). If anyone ever
implements a base-3 computer, computer scientists will be faced with the
unprecedented dilemma of a choice between two *correct* forms; both
ternary and trinary have a claim to this throne.

**h**

[from SF fandom] A method of ‘marking’ common words, i.e., calling
attention to the fact that they are being used in a nonstandard, ironic,
or humorous way. Originated in the fannish catchphrase “Bheer is the One
True Ghod!” from decades ago. H-infix marking of ‘Ghod’ and other words
spread into the 1960s counterculture via underground comix, and into
early hackerdom either from the counterculture or from SF fandom (the
three overlapped heavily at the time). More recently, the h infix has
become an expected feature of benchmark names (Dhrystone, Rhealstone,
etc.); this is probably patterning on the original Whetstone (the name
of a laboratory) but influenced by the fannish/counterculture h infix.

hidden flag

--------------

**hidden flag**: n.

[scientific computation] An extra option added to a routine without
changing the calling sequence. For example, instead of adding an
explicit input variable to instruct a routine to give extra diagnostic
output, the programmer might just add a test for some otherwise
meaningless feature of the existing inputs, such as a negative mass. The
use of hidden flags can make a program very hard to debug and
understand, but is all too common wherever programs are hacked on in a
hurry.

hog

--------------

**hog**: n.,vt.

1. Favored term to describe programs or hardware that seem to eat far
more than their share of a system's resources, esp. those which
noticeably degrade interactive response. *Not* used of programs that are
simply extremely large or complex or that are merely painfully slow
themselves. More often than not encountered in qualified forms, e.g.,
memory hog, core hog, hog the processor, hog the disk. “A controller
that never gives up the I/O bus gets killed after the bus-hog timer
expires.”

2. Also said of *people* who use more than their fair share of resources
(particularly disk, where it seems that 10% of the people use 90% of the
disk, no matter how big the disk is or how many people use it). Of
course, once disk hogs fill up one filesystem, they typically find some
other new one to infect, claiming to the sysadmin that they have an
important new project to complete.

**hole**: n.

A region in an otherwise `*flat* <../F/flat.html>`__ entity which is not
actually present. For example, some Unix filesystems can store large
files with holes so that unused regions of the file are never actually
stored on disk. (In techspeak, these are referred to as ‘sparse’ files.)
As another example, the region of memory in IBM PCs reserved for
memory-mapped I/O devices which may not actually be present is called
‘the I/O hole’, since memory-management systems must skip over this area
when filling user requests for memory.

H

**hollised**: /hol´ist/, adj.

[Usenet: ``sci.space``] To be hollised is to have been ordered by one's
employer not to post any even remotely job-related material to Usenet
(or, by extension, to other Internet media). The original and most
notorious case of this involved one Ken Hollis, a Lockheed employee and
space-program enthusiast who posted publicly available material on
access to Space Shuttle launches to ``sci.space``. He was gagged under
threat of being fired in 1994 at the behest of NASA public-relations
officers. The result was, of course, a huge publicity black eye for
NASA. Nevertheless several other NASA contractor employees were
subsequently hollised for similar activities. Use of this term carries
the strong connotation that the persons doing the gagging are
bureaucratic idiots blinded to their own best interests by territorial
reflexes.

`*flame war* <../F/flame-war.html>`__\ s over `*religious
issues* <../R/religious-issues.html>`__. The paper by Danny Cohen that
popularized the terms `*big-endian* <../B/big-endian.html>`__ and
`*little-endian* <../L/little-endian.html>`__ in connection with the
LSB-first/MSB-first controversy was entitled *On Holy Wars and a Plea
for Peace*.

Great holy wars of the past have included `*ITS* <../I/ITS.html>`__ vs.:
`*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__, `*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__ vs.:
`*VMS* <../V/VMS.html>`__, `*BSD* <../B/BSD.html>`__ Unix vs.: System V,
`*C* <../C/C.html>`__ vs.: `*Pascal* <../P/Pascal.html>`__,
`*C* <../C/C.html>`__ vs.: FORTRAN, etc. In the year 2003, popular
favorites of the day are KDE vs, GNOME, vim vs. elvis, Linux vs.
[Free\|Net\|Open]BSD. Hardy perennials include
`*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__ vs.: `*vi* <../V/vi.html>`__, my personal
computer vs.: everyone else's personal computer, ad nauseam. The
characteristic that distinguishes holy wars from normal technical
disputes is that in a holy war most of the participants spend their time
trying to pass off personal value choices and cultural attachments as
objective technical evaluations. This happens precisely because in a
true holy war, the actual substantive differences between the sides are
relatively minor. See also `*theology* <../T/theology.html>`__.

hook

`Prev <honey-pot.html>`__ 

H

 `Next <hop.html>`__

--------------

**hook**: n.

A software or hardware feature included in order to simplify later
additions or changes by a user. For example, a simple program that
prints numbers might always print them in base 10, but a more flexible
version would let a variable determine what base to use; setting the
variable to 5 would make the program print numbers in base 5. The
variable is a simple hook. An even more flexible program might examine
the variable and treat a value of 16 or less as the base to use, but
treat any other number as the address of a user-supplied routine for
printing a number. This is a `*hairy* <hairy.html>`__ but powerful hook;
one can then write a routine to print numbers as Roman numerals, say, or
as Hebrew characters, and plug it into the program through the hook.
Often the difference between a good program and a superb one is that the
latter has useful hooks in judiciously chosen places. Both may do the
original job about equally well, but the one with the hooks is much more
flexible for future expansion of capabilities
(`*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__, for example, is *all* hooks). The term
user exit is synonymous but much more formal and less hackish.

**hosed**: adj.

Same as `*down* <../D/down.html>`__. Used primarily by Unix hackers.
Humorous: also implies a condition thought to be relatively easy to
reverse. Probably derived from the Canadian slang ‘hoser’ popularized by
the Bob and Doug Mackenzie skits on SCTV, but this usage predated SCTV
by years in hackerdom (it was certainly already live at CMU in the
1970s). See `*hose* <hose.html>`__. It is also widely used of people in
the mainstream sense of ‘in an extremely unfortunate situation’.

Once upon a time, a Cray that had been experiencing periodic
difficulties crashed, and it was announced to have been hosed. It was
discovered that the crash was due to the disconnection of some coolant
hoses. The problem was corrected, and users were then assured that
everything was OK because the system had been rehosed. See also

**hotlink**: /hot´link/, n.

A `*hot spot* <hot-spot.html>`__ on a World Wide Web page; an area,
which, when clicked or selected, chases a URL. Also spelled ‘hot link’.
Use of this term focuses on the link's role as an immediate part of your
display, as opposed to the timeless sense of logical connection
suggested by `*web pointer* <../W/web-pointer.html>`__. Your screen
shows hotlinks but your document has web pointers, not (in normal usage)
the other way around.

hot spot

--------------

**hot spot**: n.

1. [primarily used by C/Unix programmers, but spreading] It is received
wisdom that in most programs, less than 10% of the code eats 90% of the
execution time; if one were to graph instruction visits versus code
addresses, one would typically see a few huge spikes amidst a lot of
low-level noise. Such spikes are called hot spots and are good
candidates for heavy optimization or
`*hand-hacking* <hand-hacking.html>`__. The term is especially used of
tight loops and recursions in the code's central algorithm, as opposed
to (say) initial set-up costs or large but infrequent I/O operations.
See `*tune* <../T/tune.html>`__, `*hand-hacking* <hand-hacking.html>`__.

2. The active location of a cursor on a bit-map display. “Put the
mouse's hot spot on the ‘ON’ widget and click the left button.”

3. A screen region that is sensitive to mouse gestures, which trigger
some action. World Wide Web pages now provide the
`*canonical* <../C/canonical.html>`__ examples; WWW browsers present
hypertext links as hot spots which, when clicked on, point the browser
at another document (these are specifically called
`*hotlink* <hotlink.html>`__\ s).

4. In a massively parallel computer with shared memory, the one location
that all 10,000 processors are trying to read or write at once (perhaps
because they are all doing a `*busy-wait* <../B/busy-wait.html>`__ on
the same lock).

5. More generally, any place in a hardware design that turns into a
performance bottleneck due to resource contention.

house wizard

--------------

**house wizard**: n.

[prob.: from ad-agency tradetalk, ‘house freak’] A hacker occupying a
technical-specialist, R&D, or systems position at a commercial shop. A
really effective house wizard can have influence out of all proportion
to his/her ostensible rank and still not have to wear a suit. Used esp.
of Unix wizards. The term house guru is equivalent.

**HP-SUX**: /H·P suhks/, n.

Unflattering hackerism for HP-UX, Hewlett-Packard's Unix port, which
features some truly unique bogosities in the filesystem internals and
elsewhere (these occasionally create portability problems). HP-UX is
often referred to as ‘hockey-pux’ inside HP, and one respondent claims
that the proper pronunciation is /H·P ukkkhhhh/ as though one were about
to spit. Another such alternate spelling and pronunciation is “H-PUX”
/H-puhks/. Hackers at HP/Apollo (the former Apollo Computers which was
swallowed by HP in 1989) have been heard to complain that Mr. Packard
should have pushed to have his name first, if for no other reason than
the greater eloquence of the resulting acronym. See
`*sun-stools* <../S/sun-stools.html>`__,
`*Slowlaris* <../S/Slowlaris.html>`__.

hung

--------------

**hung**: adj.

[from ‘hung up’; common] Equivalent to `*wedged* <../W/wedged.html>`__,
but more common at Unix/C sites. Not generally used of people. Syn. with
`*locked up* <../L/locked-up.html>`__, `*wedged* <../W/wedged.html>`__;
compare `*hosed* <hosed.html>`__. See also `*hang* <hang.html>`__. A
hung state is distinguished from `*crash* <../C/crash.html>`__\ ed or
`*down* <../D/down.html>`__, where the program or system is also
unusable but because it is not running rather than because it is waiting
for something. However, the recovery from both situations is often the
same. It is also distinguished from the similar but more drastic state
`*wedged* <../W/wedged.html>`__ — hung software can be woken up with
easy things like interrupt keys, but wedged will need a kill -9 or even
reboot.

**hyperspace**: /hi:´per·spays/, n.

A memory location that is *far* away from where the program counter
should be pointing, especially a place that is inaccessible because it
is not even mapped in by the virtual-memory system. “Another core dump —
looks like the program jumped off to hyperspace somehow.” (Compare
`*jump off into never-never
land* <../J/jump-off-into-never-never-land.html>`__.) This usage is from
the SF notion of a spaceship jumping into hyperspace, that is, taking a
shortcut through higher-dimensional space — in other words, bypassing
this universe. The variant east hyperspace is recorded among CMU and
Bliss hackers.

stupid way for backwards compatibility, and moreover that the feature it
must be compatible with was the result of a bad design in the first
place. “All IBM PC video adapters have to support MDA text mode for
hysterical reasons.” Compare `*bug-for-bug
