1. n. Spiciness.

4. vt. To modify, usually to correct; esp. used when the action is
performed with a debugger or binary patching tool. Also implies surgical
precision. “Zap the debug level to 6 and run it again.” In the IBM
mainframe world, binary patches are applied to programs or to the OS
with a program called ‘superzap’, whose file name is ‘IMASPZAP’
(possibly contrived from I M A SuPerZAP).

**Zawinski's Law**

“Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs
which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.” Coined by Jamie
Zawinski (who called it the “Law of Software Envelopment”) to express
his belief that all truly useful programs experience pressure to evolve
into toolkits and application platforms (the mailer thing, he says, is
just a side effect of that). It is commonly cited, though with widely
varying degrees of accuracy.

given entity (such as: windows in a window system, letters in an OS's
filenames, etc.). Specifically, one should either disallow the entity
entirely, allow exactly one instance (an “exception”), or allow as many
as the user wants — address space and memory permitting.

The logic behind this rule is that there are often situations where it
makes clear sense to allow one of something instead of none. However, if
one decides to go further and allow N (for N > 1), then why not N+1? And
if N+1, then why not N+2, and so on? Once above 1, there's no excuse not

First. Among software designers, comes from C's and LISP's 0-based
indexing of arrays. Hardware people also tend to start counting at 0
instead of 1; this is natural since, e.g., the 256 states of 8 bits
correspond to the binary numbers 0, 1, ..., 255 and the digital devices
known as counters count in this way.

Hackers and computer scientists often like to call the first chapter of
a publication ‘Chapter 0’, especially if it is of an introductory nature
(one of the classic instances was in the First Edition of
`*K&R* <../K/K-ampersand-R.html>`__). In recent years this trait has
also been observed among many pure mathematicians (who have an
independent tradition of numbering from 0). Zero-based numbering tends

“zorch” appears to have been coined on Blanchard's show in the early
1950s. The word itself had no meaning, but there where compounds using
it that did — “zorch cow”, for example, was a variant of the
Chicago-area slang “black cow” for a root beer float.
