--------------

**YABA**: /ya´b@/, n.

[Cambridge] Yet Another Bloody Acronym. Whenever some program is being
named, someone invariably suggests that it be given a name that is
acronymic. The response from those with a trace of originality is to
remark ironically that the proposed name would then be
‘YABA-compatible’. Also used in response to questions like “What is
WYSIWYG?” See also `*TLA* <../T/TLA.html>`__.

--------------

**YAFIYGI**: /yaf´ee·y@·gee/, adj.

[coined in response to WYSIWYG] Describes the command-oriented
ed/vi/nroff/TeX style of word processing or other user interface, the
opposite of `*WYSIWYG* <../W/WYSIWYG.html>`__. Stands for “You asked for
it, you got it”, because what you actually asked for is often not
apparent until long after it is too late to do anything about it. Used
to denote perversity (“Real Programmers use YAFIYGI tools...and *like*
it!”) or, less often, a necessary tradeoff (“Only a YAFIYGI tool can
have full programmable flexibility in its interface.”).

This precise sense of “You asked for it, you got it” seems to have first
appeared in Ed Post's classic parody *Real Programmers don't use Pascal*
(see `*Real Programmer* <../R/Real-Programmer.html>`__\ s); the acronym
is a more recent invention.

**You know you've been hacking too long when**

The set-up line for a genre of one-liners told by hackers about
themselves. These include the following:

-  not only do you check your email more often than your paper mail, but
   you remember your `*network address* <../N/network-address.html>`__
   faster than your postal one.

-  your `*SO* <../S/SO.html>`__ kisses you on the neck and the first
   thing you think is “Uh, oh, `*priority
   interrupt* <../P/priority-interrupt.html>`__.”

-  you go to balance your checkbook and discover that you're doing it in
   octal.

-  your computers have a higher street value than your car.

-  in your universe, ‘round numbers’ are powers of 2, not 10.

-  more than once, you have woken up recalling a dream in some
   programming language.

-  you see the word “Oxford” and mentally trip over the fact that ‘r’ is
   not a hex digit.

-  you realize you have never seen half of your best friends.

A `list <http://albrecht.ecn.purdue.edu/~taylor/humor/hack.html>`__ of
these can be found by searching for this phrase on the web.

[An early version of this entry said “All but one of these have been
reliably reported as hacker traits (some of them quite often). Even
hackers may have trouble spotting the ringer.” The ringer was balancing
one's checkbook in octal, which I made up out of whole cloth. Although
more respondents picked that one out as fiction than any of the others,
I also received multiple independent reports of its actually happening,
most famously to Grace Hopper while she was working with BINAC in 1949.

The state in which the system is said to be when it rapidly alternates
several times between being up and being down. Interestingly (and
perhaps not by coincidence), many hardware vendors give out free yoyos
at Usenix exhibits.

Sun Microsystems gave out logoized yoyos at SIGPLAN '88. Tourists
staying at one of Atlanta's most respectable hotels were subsequently
treated to the sight of 200 of the country's top computer scientists
testing yo-yo algorithms in the lobby.

Yu-Shiang Whole Fish

--------------

**Yu-Shiang Whole Fish**: /yoo·shyang hohl fish/, n. obs.

The character gamma (extended SAIL ASCII 0001001), which with a loop in
its tail looks like a little fish swimming down the page. The term is
actually the name of a Chinese dish in which a fish is cooked whole (not
`*parse* <../P/parse.html>`__\ d) and covered with Yu-Shiang (or
Yu-Hsiang, or in modern Pinyin transliteration yuxiang) sauce. Usage:
primarily by people on the MIT LISP Machine, which could display this
character on the screen. Tends to elicit incredulity from people who
hear about it second-hand.

Yu Shiang Whole Fish is alive and well in Unicode as U+0263 LATIN SMALL
LETTER GAMMA (as opposed to the actual Greek letter at U+03B3, which
usually has a loopless glyph; the form of U+0263 is consistently loopy).
This symbol is included in Unicode as a Latin letter because it is used
in the International Phonetic Alphabet. In the IPA, gamma represents a
voiced velar fricative, the sound commonly transcribed “gh” in Arabic or
Klingon.
