**YABA**: /ya´b@/, n.

[Cambridge] Yet Another Bloody Acronym. Whenever some program is being
named, someone invariably suggests that it be given a name that is
acronymic. The response from those with a trace of originality is to
remark ironically that the proposed name would then be
‘YABA-compatible’. Also used in response to questions like “What is

it, you got it”, because what you actually asked for is often not
apparent until long after it is too late to do anything about it. Used
to denote perversity (“Real Programmers use YAFIYGI tools...and *like*
it!”) or, less often, a necessary tradeoff (“Only a YAFIYGI tool can
have full programmable flexibility in its interface.”).

This precise sense of “You asked for it, you got it” seems to have first
appeared in Ed Post's classic parody *Real Programmers don't use Pascal*

[An early version of this entry said “All but one of these have been
reliably reported as hacker traits (some of them quite often). Even
hackers may have trouble spotting the ringer.” The ringer was balancing
one's checkbook in octal, which I made up out of whole cloth. Although
more respondents picked that one out as fiction than any of the others,
I also received multiple independent reports of its actually happening,
most famously to Grace Hopper while she was working with BINAC in 1949.

**Yu-Shiang Whole Fish**: /yoo·shyang hohl fish/, n. obs.

The character gamma (extended SAIL ASCII 0001001), which with a loop in
its tail looks like a little fish swimming down the page. The term is
actually the name of a Chinese dish in which a fish is cooked whole (not

Yu-Hsiang, or in modern Pinyin transliteration yuxiang) sauce. Usage:
primarily by people on the MIT LISP Machine, which could display this
character on the screen. Tends to elicit incredulity from people who
hear about it second-hand.

Yu Shiang Whole Fish is alive and well in Unicode as U+0263 LATIN SMALL
LETTER GAMMA (as opposed to the actual Greek letter at U+03B3, which
usually has a loopless glyph; the form of U+0263 is consistently loopy).
This symbol is included in Unicode as a Latin letter because it is used
in the International Phonetic Alphabet. In the IPA, gamma represents a
voiced velar fricative, the sound commonly transcribed “gh” in Arabic or
Klingon.
