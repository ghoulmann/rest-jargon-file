`*RFC* <../R/RFC.html>`__-1025, *TCP and IP Bake Off* says:

    10 points for correctly being able to process a “Kamikaze” packet
    (AKA nastygram, christmas tree packet, lamp test segment, et al.).
    That is, correctly handle a segment with the maximum combination of
    features at once (e.g., a SYN URG PUSH FIN segment with options and
    data).

**ken**: /ken/, n.

1. [Unix] Ken Thompson, principal inventor of Unix. In the early days he
used to hand-cut distribution tapes, often with a note that read “Love,
ken”. Old-timers still use his first name (sometimes uncapitalized,
because it's a login name and mail address) in third-person reference;
it is widely understood (on Usenet, in particular) that without a last
name ‘Ken’ refers only to Ken Thompson. Similarly, ‘Dennis’ without last
name means Dennis Ritchie (and he is often known as ``dmr``). See also
`*demigod* <../D/demigod.html>`__, `*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__.

2. A flaming user. This was originated by the Software Support group at
Symbolics because the two greatest flamers in the user community were
both named Ken.

**killer app**

The application that actually makes a sustaining market for a promising
but under-utilized technology. First used in the mid-1980s to describe
Lotus 1-2-3 once it became evident that demand for that product had been
the major driver of the early business market for IBM PCs. The term was
then retrospectively applied to VisiCalc, which had played a similar
role in the success of the Apple II. After 1994 it became commonplace to
describe the World Wide Web as the Internet's killer app. One of the
standard questions asked about each new personal-computer technology as
it emerges has become “what's the killer app?”

**killer micro**: n.

[popularized by Eugene Brooks c.1990] A microprocessor-based machine
that infringes on mini, mainframe, or supercomputer performance turf.
Often heard in “No one will survive the attack of the killer micros!”,
the battle cry of the downsizers.

The popularity of the phrase ‘attack of the killer micros’ is doubtless
reinforced by the title of the movie *Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes*
(one of the `*canonical* <../C/canonical.html>`__ examples of
so-bad-it's-wonderful among hackers). This has even more
`*flavor* <../F/flavor.html>`__ now that killer micros have gone on the
offensive not just individually (in workstations) but in hordes (within
massively parallel computers).

[2002 update: Eugene Brooks was right. Since this term first entered the
Jargon File in 1990, the minicomputer has effectively vanished, the
`*mainframe* <../M/mainframe.html>`__ sector is in deep and apparently
terminal decline, and even the supercomputer business has contracted
into a smaller niche. It's networked killer micros as far as the eye can
see. —ESR]

**kludge**

1. /kluhj/ n. Incorrect (though regrettably common) spelling of
`*kluge* <kluge.html>`__ (US). These two words have been confused in
American usage since the early 1960s, and widely confounded in Great
Britain since the end of World War II.

2. [TMRC] A `*crock* <../C/crock.html>`__ that works. (A long-ago
*Datamation* article by Jackson Granholme similarly said: “An
ill-assorted collection of poorly matching parts, forming a distressing
whole.”)

3. v. To use a kludge to get around a problem. “I've kludged around it
for now, but I'll fix it up properly later.”

This word appears to have derived from Scots kludge or kludgie for a
common toilet, via British military slang. It apparently became confused
with U.S. `*kluge* <kluge.html>`__ during or after World War II; some
Britons from that era use both words in definably different ways, but
`*kluge* <kluge.html>`__ is now uncommon in Great Britain. ‘Kludge’ in
Commonwealth hackish differs in meaning from ‘kluge’ in that it lacks
the positive senses; a kludge is something no Commonwealth hacker wants
to be associated too closely with. Also, ‘kludge’ is more widely known
in British mainstream slang than ‘kluge’ is in the U.S.

Often involves `*ad-hockery* <../A/ad-hockery.html>`__ and verges on
being a `*crock* <../C/crock.html>`__.

3. n. Something that works for the wrong reason.

4. vt. To insert a kluge into a program. “I've kluged this routine to
get around that weird bug, but there's probably a better way.”

5. [WPI] n. A feature that is implemented in a
`*rude* <../R/rude.html>`__ manner.

Nowadays this term is often encountered in the variant spelling
‘kludge’. Reports from `*old fart* <../O/old-fart.html>`__\ s are
consistent that ‘kluge’ was the original spelling, reported around
computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used
exclusively of *hardware* kluges. In 1947, the *New York Folklore
Quarterly* reported a classic shaggy-dog story ‘Murgatroyd the Kluge
Maker’ then current in the Armed Forces, in which a ‘kluge’ was a
complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function. Other sources
report that ‘kluge’ was common Navy slang in the WWII era for any piece
of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea.

However, there is reason to believe this slang use may be a decade
older. Several respondents have connected it to the brand name of a
device called a “Kluge paper feeder”, an adjunct to mechanical printing
presses. Legend has it that the Kluge feeder was designed before small,
cheap electric motors and control electronics; it relied on a fiendishly
complex assortment of cams, belts, and linkages to both power and
synchronize all its operations from one motive driveshaft. It was
accordingly temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and
devilishly difficult to repair — but oh, so clever! People who tell this
story also aver that ‘Kluge’ was the name of a design engineer.

There is in fact a Brandtjen & Kluge Inc., an old family business that
manufactures printing equipment — interestingly, their name is
pronounced /kloo´gee/! Henry Brandtjen, president of the firm, told me
(ESR, 1994) that his company was co-founded by his father and an
engineer named Kluge /kloo´gee/, who built and co-designed the original
Kluge automatic feeder in 1919. Mr. Brandtjen claims, however, that this
was a *simple* device (with only four cams); he says he has no idea how
the myth of its complexity took hold. Other correspondents differ with
Mr. Brandtjen's history of the device and his allegation that it was a
simple rather than complex one, but agree that the Kluge automatic
feeder was the most likely source of the folklore.

`*TMRC* <../T/TMRC.html>`__ and the MIT hacker culture of the early '60s
seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some
WWII military slang (see also `*foobar* <../F/foobar.html>`__). It seems
likely that ‘kluge’ came to MIT via alumni of the many military
electronics projects that had been located in Cambridge (many in MIT's
venerable Building 20, in which `*TMRC* <../T/TMRC.html>`__ is also
located) during the war.

The variant ‘kludge’ was apparently popularized by the
`*Datamation* <../D/Datamation.html>`__ article mentioned under
`*kludge* <kludge.html>`__; it was titled *How to Design a Kludge*
(February 1962, pp. 30, 31). This spelling was probably imported from
Great Britain, where `*kludge* <kludge.html>`__ has an independent
history (though this fact was largely unknown to hackers on either side
of the Atlantic before a mid-1993 debate in the Usenet group
``alt.folklore.computers`` over the First and Second Edition versions of
this entry; everybody used to think `*kludge* <kludge.html>`__ was just
a mutation of `*kluge* <kluge.html>`__). It now appears that the
British, having forgotten the etymology of their own ‘kludge’ when
‘kluge’ crossed the Atlantic, repaid the U.S. by lobbing the ‘kludge’
orthography in the other direction and confusing their American cousins'
spelling!

The result of this history is a tangle. Many younger U.S. hackers
pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its meaning
and pronunciation, as ‘kludge’. (Phonetically, consider huge, refuge,
centrifuge, and deluge as opposed to sludge, judge, budge, and fudge.
Whatever its failings in other areas, English spelling is perfectly
consistent about this distinction.) British hackers mostly learned
/kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least
consistent. European hackers have mostly learned the word from written
American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider
American meaning!

Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's
meaning.

1. [RPI] Renssaleer Polytechnic Institute local slang roughly equivalent

2. In older usage at RPI, the term signified someone new to college
life, fresh out of high school, and wet behind the ears.

An IEEE Spectrum article (4/95, page 16) once derived ‘nerd’ in its
variant form ‘knurd’ from the word ‘drunk’ backwards; this etymology was
common at RPI. Though it is commonly confused with
`*nerd* <../N/nerd.html>`__, it appears these words have separate
origins (compare the `*kluge* <kluge.html>`__/`*kludge* <kludge.html>`__

**kook**

[Usenet; originally and more formally, net.kook] Term used to describe a
regular poster who continually posts messages with no apparent grounding
in reality. Different from a `*troll* <../T/troll.html>`__, which
implies a sort of sly wink on the part of a poster who knows better,
kooks really believe what they write, to the extent that they believe
anything.

The kook trademark is paranoia and grandiosity. Kooks will often build
up elaborate imaginary support structures, fake corporations and the
like, and continue to act as if those things are real even after their
falsity has been documented in public.

While they may appear harmless, and are usually filtered out by the
other regular participants in a newsgroup of mailing list, they can
still cause problems because the necessity for these measures is not
immediately apparent to newcomers; there are several instances on
record, for example, of journalists writing stories with quotes from
kooks who caught them unaware.

kooks can be found at

**Kool-Aid**

[from a kid's sugar-enriched drink in fruity flavors] When someone who
should know better succumbs to marketing influences and actually begins
to believe the propaganda being dished out by a vendor, they are said to
have drunk the Kool-Aid. Usually the decortication process is slow and
almost unnoticeable until one day the victim emerges as a True Believer
and begins spreading the faith himself. The term originates in the
suicide of 914 followers of Jim Jones's People's Temple cult in Guyana
in 1978 (there are also resonances with Ken Kesey's Electric Kool-Aid
Acid Tests from the 1960s). What the Jonestown victims actually drank
was cyanide-laced Flavor-Aid, a cheap knockoff, rather than Kool-Aid
itself. There is a
`FAQ <http://www.cs.uu.nl/wais/html/na-dir/food/kool-aid-faq.html>`__ on
this topic.

This has live variants. When a suit is blithering on about their latest
technology and how it will save the world, that's ‘pouring Kool-Aid’.
When the suit does not violate the laws of physics, doesn't make
impossible claims, and in fact says something reasonable and believable,
that's pouring good Kool-Aid, usually used in the sentence “He pours
good Kool-Aid, doesn't he?” This connotes that the speaker might be
about to drink same.

**kremvax**: /krem·vaks/, n.

[from the then-large number of `*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__
`*VAXen* <../V/VAXen.html>`__ with names of the form ``foovax``]
Originally, a fictitious Usenet site at the Kremlin, announced on April
1, 1984 in a posting ostensibly originated there by Soviet leader
Konstantin Chernenko. The
`posting <%20%20%20%20http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=0001%40kremvax.UUCP>`__
was actually forged by Piet Beertema as an April Fool's joke. Other
fictitious sites mentioned in the hoax were ``moskvax`` and
`*kgbvax* <kgbvax.html>`__. This was probably the funniest of the many
April Fool's forgeries perpetrated on Usenet (which has negligible
security against them), because the notion that Usenet might ever
penetrate the Iron Curtain seemed so totally absurd at the time.

In fact, it was only six years later that the first genuine site in
Moscow, ``demos.su``, joined Usenet. Some readers needed convincing that
the postings from it weren't just another prank. Vadim Antonov, senior
programmer at Demos and the major poster from there up to mid-1991, was
quite aware of all this, referred to it frequently in his own postings,
and at one point twitted some credulous readers by blandly asserting
that he *was* a hoax!

Eventually he even arranged to have the domain's gateway site named
``kremvax``, thus neatly turning fiction into fact and demonstrating
that the hackish sense of humor transcends cultural barriers. [Mr.
Antonov also contributed the Russian-language material for this lexicon.
—ESR]

In an even more ironic historical footnote, ``kremvax`` became an
electronic center of the anti-communist resistance during the bungled
hard-line coup of August 1991. During those three days the Soviet UUCP
network centered on ``kremvax`` became the only trustworthy news source
for many places within the USSR. Though the sysops were concentrating on
internal communications, cross-border postings included immediate
transliterations of Boris Yeltsin's decrees condemning the coup and
eyewitness reports of the demonstrations in Moscow's streets. In those
hours, years of speculation that totalitarianism would prove unable to
maintain its grip on politically-loaded information in the age of
computer networking were proved devastatingly accurate — and the
original ``kremvax`` joke became a reality as Yeltsin and the new
Russian revolutionaries of glasnost and perestroika made ``kremvax`` one
of the timeliest means of their outreach to the West.
