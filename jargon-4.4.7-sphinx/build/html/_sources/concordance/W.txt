**w00t**

An interjection similar to “Yay!”, as in: “w00t!!! I just got a raise!”
Often used for small victories the speaker dies not expect to be of
special interest to anyone else. Some claim this is a bastardization of
“root”, the highest level of access to a system (particularly UNIX),
originated by script kiddies as a 133tspeak equivalent of “root”, and
said as an exclamation upon gaining root access. Others claim it
originated in the Everquest multiplayer game as an abbreviation of
“wonderful loot”. Still other claim it on originated on IRC as the “Ewok
victory cheer”] Adj. w00table has the sense of “cool” or “nifty”. This
is one of the few leet-speak coinages to have crossed over into
non-ironic use among hackers.

the story, which he wrote in 1942. Now known by the more generic term

angular momentum; the combination of a misaligned spindle or worn
bearings and stick-slip interactions with the floor could cause them to
‘walk’ across a room, lurching alternate corners forward a couple of
millimeters at a time. There is a legend about a drive that walked over
to the only door to the computer room and jammed it shut; the staff had
to cut a hole in the wall in order to get at it! Walking could also be
induced by certain patterns of drive access (a fast seek across the
whole width of the disk, followed by a slow seek in the other
direction). Some bands of old-time hackers figured out how to induce
disk-accessing patterns that would do this to particular drive models
and held disk-drive races.

A person or algorithm that compensates for lack of sophistication or

necessarily pejorative; it recalls ‘Harvey Wallbanger’, the winning
robot in an early AI contest (named, of course, after the cocktail).
Harvey successfully solved mazes by keeping a ‘finger’ on one wall and
running till it came out the other end. This was inelegant, but it was
mathematically guaranteed to work on simply-connected mazes — and, in
fact, Harvey outperformed more sophisticated robots that tried to
‘learn’ each maze by building an internal representation of it. Used of
humans, the term *is* pejorative and implies an uncreative,

**wallhack**

A form of game cheat especially associated with first-person shooters
like Quake, in which the walls in the simulated maze or dungeon are
rendered transparent to the cheater. This gives the cheater normally
hidden information about the whereabouts of other players. Beyond
gaming, a wallhack is the paradigm case of a whole class of security
problems that stem from the fact that a server cannot trust client
software, and server authors must assume that all computation farmed out
to a client is exposed to and can be interfered with by the user.

It is said that sense 1 came from the idiom ‘like talking to a blank
wall’. It was originally used in situations where, after you had
carefully answered a question, the questioner stared at you blankly,
clearly having understood nothing that was explained. You would then
throw out a “Hello, wall?” to elicit some sort of response from the
questioner. Later, confused questioners began voicing “Wall?”

largely unconscious and unaffected by models known in popular culture —
communities formed spontaneously around people who, *as individuals*,
felt irresistibly drawn to do hackerly things, and what wannabees
experienced was a fairly pure, skill-focused desire to become similarly
wizardly. Those days of innocence are gone forever; society's adaptation
to the advent of the microcomputer after 1980 included the elevation of
the hacker as a new kind of folk hero, and the result is that some
people semi-consciously set out to *be hackers* and borrow hackish
prestige by fitting the popular image of hackers. Fortunately, to do
this really well, one has to actually become a wizard. Nevertheless,
old-time hackers tend to share a poorly articulated disquiet about the
change; among other things, it gives them mixed feelings about the
effects of public compendia of lore like this one.

The practice of using chalk marks similar to hobo signs to indicate the
nearby presence of a wireless Internet access point, a boon to strolling
hackers with laptops. The concept was first floated in early 2002 and
was instantly seized upon with cries of glee by hackers all over the
portions of the world urbanized enough to have sidewalks and access

the medieval Europe of the 1120s. There is a site that `explains the

detect modem, fax, or PBX tones and log each one separately. The war

    Warez d00dz get illegal copies of copyrighted software. If it has

    like. They put up boards that distribute the latest ware, or pirate
    program. The whole point of the Warez sub-culture is to get the
    pirate program released and distributed before any other group. I
    know, I know. But don't ask, and it won't hurt as much. This is how
    they prove their poweress [sic]. It gives them the right to say, “I

The studly thing to do if one is a warez d00d, it appears, is emit 0-day
warez, that is copies of commercial software copied and cracked on the
same day as its retail release. Warez d00ds also hoard software in a big
way, collecting untold megabytes of arcade-style games, pornographic
JPGs, and applications they'll never use onto their hard disks. As Ozone
Pilot acutely observes:

    [BELONG] is the only word you will need to know. Warez d00dz want to
    belong. They have been shunned by everyone, and thus turn to
    cyberspace for acceptance. That is why they always start groups like
    TGW, FLT, USA and the like. Structure makes them happy. [...] Warez
    d00dz will never have a handle like “Pink Daisy” because warez d00dz
    are insecure. Only someone who is very secure with a good dose of
    self-esteem can stand up to the cries of fag and girlie-man. More
    likely you will find warez d00dz with handles like: Doctor Death,
    Deranged Lunatic, Hellraiser, Mad Prince, Dreamdevil, The Unknown,
    Renegade Chemist, Terminator, and Twin Turbo. They like to sound
    badass when they can hide behind their terminals. More likely, if
    you were given a sample of 100 people, the person whose handle is
    Hellraiser is the last person you'd associate with the name.

publications?”) or for demos (“They webified their 6.866 final
project”). This term seems to have been (rather logically) independently
invented multiple times in the early 1990s.

**wedged**: adj.

1. To be stuck, incapable of proceeding without help. This is different
from having crashed. If the system has crashed, it has become totally
non-functioning. If the system is wedged, it is trying to do something
but cannot make progress; it may be capable of doing a few things, but
not be fully operational. For example, a process may become wedged if it

2. Often refers to humans suffering misconceptions. “He's totally wedged
— he's convinced that he can levitate through meditation.”

3. [Unix] Specifically used to describe the state of a TTY left in a
losing state by abort of a screen-oriented program or one that has
messed with the line discipline in some obscure way.

There is some dispute over the origin of this term. It is usually
thought to derive from a common description of recto-cranial inversion;
however, it may actually have originated with older ‘hot-press’ printing
technology in which physical type elements were locked into type frames
with wedges driven in by mallets. Once this had been done, no changes in
the typesetting for that page could be made.

**weenie**: n.

1. [on BBSes] Any of a species of luser resembling a less amusing
version of `*B1FF* <../B/B1FF.html>`__ that infests many
`*BBS* <../B/BBS.html>`__ systems. The typical weenie is a teenage boy
with poor social skills travelling under a grandiose
`*handle* <../H/handle.html>`__ derived from fantasy or heavy-metal rock
lyrics. Among sysops, the weenie problem refers to the marginally
literate and profanity-laden `*flamage* <../F/flamage.html>`__ weenies
tend to spew all over a newly-discovered BBS. Compare
`*spod* <../S/spod.html>`__, `*geek* <../G/geek.html>`__, `*terminal
junkie* <../T/terminal-junkie.html>`__, `*warez
d00dz* <warez-d00dz.html>`__.

2. [among hackers] When used with a qualifier (for example, as in `*Unix
weenie* <../U/Unix-weenie.html>`__, VMS weenie, IBM weenie) this can be
either an insult or a term of praise, depending on context, tone of
voice, and whether or not it is applied by a person who considers him or
herself to be the same sort of weenie. Implies that the weenie has put a
major investment of time, effort, and concentration into the area
indicated; whether this is good or bad depends on the hearer's judgment
of how the speaker feels about that area. See also
`*bigot* <../B/bigot.html>`__.

3. The semicolon character, ``;`` (ASCII 0111011).

**Weenix**: /wee´niks/, n.

1. [ITS] A derogatory term for `*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__, derived from
`*Unix weenie* <../U/Unix-weenie.html>`__. According to one noted
ex-ITSer, it is “the operating system preferred by Unix Weenies:
typified by poor modularity, poor reliability, hard file deletion, no
file version numbers, case sensitivity everywhere, and users who believe
that these are all advantages”. (Some ITS fans behave as though they
believe Unix stole a future that rightfully belonged to them. See
`*ITS* <../I/ITS.html>`__, sense 2.)

2. [Brown University] A Unix-like OS developed for tutorial purposes at
Brown University. See
`http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs167/weenix.html <http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs167/weenix.html>`__.
Named independently of the ITS usage.

2. After sense 1 became established in the mid-1990s the term passed

windows spawned in flocks when you surf to sites like Angelfire or

[University of Maryland: from `*hacker* <../H/hacker.html>`__]

1. A person, similar to a `*hacker* <../H/hacker.html>`__, who enjoys
exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their
capabilities. Whereas a hacker tends to produce great hacks, a whacker
only ends up whacking the system or program in question. Whackers are
often quite egotistical and eager to claim `*wizard* <wizard.html>`__
status, regardless of the views of their peers.

2. A person who is good at programming quickly, though rather poorly and
ineptly.

**wheel of reincarnation**

[coined in a paper by T.H. Myer and I.E. Sutherland *On the Design of
Display Processors*, Comm. ACM, Vol. 11, no. 6, June 1968)] Term used to
refer to a well-known effect whereby function in a computing system
family is migrated out to special-purpose peripheral hardware for speed,
then the peripheral evolves toward more computing power as it does its
job, then somebody notices that it is inefficient to support two
asymmetrical processors in the architecture and folds the function back
into the main CPU, at which point the cycle begins again.

Several iterations of this cycle have been observed in
graphics-processor design, and at least one or two in communications and
floating-point processors. Also known as the Wheel of Life, the Wheel of
Samsara, and other variations of the basic Hindu/Buddhist theological

**Whorfian mind-lock**

[from the Lojban-language list] Software designs are often restricted in
unavoidable ways by the capacities of the operating system or hardware
they have to work with. Sometimes they are restricted in avoidable ways
by mental habits a developer has picked up from a particular language or
environment (perhaps a now-obsolete one) and never discarded. When a
design develops complications that are the result of a mental habit that
is no longer adaptive, the developer has succumbed to Whorfian
mind-lock. The design itself has been ‘whorfed’.

For example, some Unix designs are whorfed by the assumption that
directory searches are linear and expensive for large directories;
therefore directories must be kept small. Another common way to succumb
to Whorfian mind-lock is to do serial processing with a small working
set rather than slurping an entire file or data structure into memory;
the hidden assumption here is that not much core is available and
virtual memory works poorly if at all. Detecting Whorfian mind-lock is
important, because it tends to introduce unnecessary complexity and
bugs.

unstable waveform, so it grows to dominate the solution. Alternatively,
stable (though inaccurate) wiggles can be generated near a discontinuity
by a Gibbs phenomenon.

There is a legend that the name arose because the original 1973

30-megabyte volumes; 30--30 became ‘Winchester’ when somebody noticed
the similarity to the common term for a famous Winchester rifle (in the
latter, the first 30 referred to caliber and the second to the grain
weight of the charge). (It is sometimes incorrectly claimed that
Winchester was the laboratory in which the technology was developed.)

**Windowsitis**

1. As a disease of people: the tendency of inexperienced (or
Windows-experienced) Web developers have to use backslashes in URLs,
rather than the correct forward slashes.

2. As a disease of programs: to be a rigid, clunky, bug-prone
monstrosity, all glossy surface with a hollow interior.

**wormhole**: /werm´hohl/, n.

[from the wormhole singularities hypothesized in some versions of
General Relativity theory]

1. [n.,obs.] A location in a monitor which contains the address of a
routine, with the specific intent of making it easy to substitute a
different routine. This term is now obsolescent; modern operating
systems use clusters of wormholes extensively (for modularization of I/O
handling in particular, as in the Unix device-driver organization) but
the preferred techspeak for these clusters is ‘device tables’, ‘jump
tables’ or ‘capability tables’.

2. [Amateur Packet Radio] A network path using a commercial satellite
link to join two or more amateur VHF networks. So called because traffic
routed through a wormhole leaves and re-enters the amateur network over
great distances with usually little clue in the message routing header
as to how it got from one relay to the other. Compare `*gopher
hole* <../G/gopher-hole.html>`__ (sense 2).

2. To change `*phase* <../P/phase.html>`__ gradually and continuously by
maintaining a steady wake-sleep cycle somewhat longer than 24 hours,

**write-only memory**: n.

The obvious antonym to read-only memory. Out of frustration with the
long and seemingly useless chain of approvals required of component
specifications, during which no actual checking seemed to occur, an
engineer at Signetics once created a specification for a write-only
memory and included it with a bunch of other specifications to be
approved. This inclusion came to the attention of Signetics
`*management* <../M/management.html>`__ only when regular customers
started calling and asking for pricing information. Signetics published
a corrected edition of the data book and requested the return of the
‘erroneous’ ones. Later, in 1972, Signetics bought a double-page spread
in *Electronics* magazine's April issue and used the spec as an April
Fools' Day joke. Instead of the more conventional characteristic curves,
the 25120 “fully encoded, 9046 x N, Random Access, write-only-memory”
data sheet included diagrams of “bit capacity vs.: Temp.”, “Iff vs.
Vff”, “Number of pins remaining vs.: number of socket insertions”, and
“AQL vs.: selling price”. The 25120 required a 6.3 VAC VFF supply, a
+10V VCC, and VDD of 0V, ``±2%``.

by Gregory Yob. The wumpus lived somewhere in a cave with the topology
of an dodecahedron's edge/vertex graph (later versions supported other
topologies, including an icosahedron and Möbius strip). The player
started somewhere at random in the cave with five ‘crooked arrows’;
these could be shot through up to three connected rooms, and would kill
the wumpus on a hit (later versions introduced the wounded wumpus, which
got very angry). Unfortunately for players, the movement necessary to
map the maze was made hazardous not merely by the wumpus (which would
eat you if you stepped on him) but also by bottomless pits and colonies
of super bats that would pick you up and drop you at a random location
(later versions added ‘anaerobic termites’ that ate arrows, bat
migrations, and earthquakes that randomly changed pit locations).

This game appears to have been the first to use a non-random
graph-structured map (as opposed to a rectangular grid like the even
older Star Trek games). In this respect, as in the dungeon-like setting
and its terse, amusing messages, it prefigured
`*ADVENT* <../A/ADVENT.html>`__ and `*Zork* <../Z/Zork.html>`__ and was
directly ancestral to the latter (Zork acknowledged this heritage by
including a super-bat colony). A C emulation of the original Basic game
is available at the Retrocomputing Museum,

**WYSIAYG**: /wiz´ee·ayg/, adj.

Describes a user interface under which “What You See Is *All* You Get”;
an unhappy variant of `*WYSIWYG* <WYSIWYG.html>`__. Visual,
‘point-and-shoot’-style interfaces tend to have easy initial learning
curves, but also to lack depth; they often frustrate advanced users who
would be better served by a command-style interface. When this happens,
the frustrated user has a WYSIAYG problem. This term is most often used
of editors, word processors, and document formatting programs. WYSIWYG
‘desktop publishing’ programs, for example, are a clear win for creating
small documents with lots of fonts and graphics in them, especially
things like newsletters and presentation slides. When typesetting
book-length manuscripts, on the other hand, scale changes the nature of
the task; one quickly runs into WYSIAYG limitations, and the increased
power and flexibility of a command-driven formatter like
`*TeX* <../T/TeX.html>`__ or Unix's `*troff* <../T/troff.html>`__
becomes not just desirable but a necessity. Compare
`*YAFIYGI* <../Y/YAFIYGI.html>`__.

**WYSIWYG**: /wiz´ee·wig/, /wiss´ee·wig/, adj.

[Traced to Flip Wilson's “Geraldine” character c.1970] Describes a user
interface under which “What You See Is What You Get”, as opposed to one
that uses more-or-less obscure commands that do not result in immediate
visual feedback. True WYSIWYG in environments supporting multiple fonts
or graphics is a rarely-attained ideal; there are variants of this term
to express real-world manifestations including WYSIAWYG (What You See Is
*Almost* What You Get) and WYSIMOLWYG (What You See Is More or Less What
You Get). All these can be mildly derogatory, as they are often used to
refer to dumbed-down `*user-friendly* <../U/user-friendly.html>`__
interfaces targeted at non-programmers; a hacker has no fear of obscure
commands (compare `*WYSIAYG* <WYSIAYG.html>`__). On the other hand,
`*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__ was one of the very first WYSIWYG editors,
replacing (actually, at first overlaying) the extremely obscure,
command-based `*TECO* <../T/TECO.html>`__. See also `*WIMP
environment* <WIMP-environment.html>`__. [Oddly enough, WYSIWYG made it
into the 1986 supplement to the OED, in lower case yet. —ESR]
