**w00t**

An interjection similar to “Yay!”, as in: “w00t!!! I just got a raise!”
Often used for small victories the speaker dies not expect to be of
special interest to anyone else. Some claim this is a bastardization of
“root”, the highest level of access to a system (particularly UNIX),
originated by script kiddies as a 133tspeak equivalent of “root”, and
said as an exclamation upon gaining root access. Others claim it
originated in the Everquest multiplayer game as an abbreviation of
“wonderful loot”. Still other claim it on originated on IRC as the “Ewok
victory cheer”] Adj. w00table has the sense of “cool” or “nifty”. This
is one of the few leet-speak coinages to have crossed over into
non-ironic use among hackers.

[almost certainly from Elmer Fudd's immortal line “You wascawwy

1. A legendary early hack reported on a System/360 at RPI and elsewhere
around 1978; this may have descended (if only by inspiration) from a
hack called RABBITS reported from 1969 on a Burroughs 5500 at the
University of Washington Computer Center. The program would make two
copies of itself every time it was run, eventually crashing the system.

WAITS

--------------

**WAITS**: /wayts/, n.

The mutant cousin of `*TOPS-10* <../T/TOPS-10.html>`__ used on a handful
of systems at `*SAIL* <../S/SAIL.html>`__ up to 1990. There was never an
‘official’ expansion of WAITS (the name itself having been arrived at by
a rather sideways process), but it was frequently glossed as ‘West-coast
Alternative to ITS’. Though WAITS was less visible than ITS, there was
frequent exchange of people and ideas between the two communities, and
innovations pioneered at WAITS exerted enormous indirect influence. The
early screen modes of `*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__, for example, were
directly inspired by WAITS's ‘E’ editor — one of a family of editors
that were the first to do ‘real-time editing’, in which the editing
commands were invisible and where one typed text at the point of
insertion/overwriting. The modern style of multi-region windowing is
said to have originated there, and WAITS alumni at XEROX PARC and
elsewhere played major roles in the developments that led to the XEROX
Star, the Macintosh, and the Sun workstations. Also invented there were
`*bucky bits* <../B/bucky-bits.html>`__ — thus, the ALT key on every IBM
PC is a WAITS legacy. One WAITS feature very notable in pre-Web days was
a news-wire interface that allowed WAITS hackers to read, store, and
filter AP and UPI dispatches from their terminals; the system also
featured a still-unusual level of support for what is now called
multimedia computing, allowing analog audio and video signals to be
switched to programming terminals.

[From Robert A. Heinlein's story *Waldo*]

1. A mechanical agent, such as a gripper arm, controlled by a human
limb. When these were developed for the nuclear industry in the
mid-1940s they were named after the invention described by Heinlein in
the story, which he wrote in 1942. Now known by the more generic term
telefactoring, this technology is of intense interest to NASA for tasks
like space station maintenance.

2. At Harvard (particularly by Tom Cheatham and students), this is used

**walking drives**: n.

An occasional failure mode of magnetic-disk drives back in the days when
they were huge, clunky `*washing machine* <washing-machine.html>`__\ s.
Those old `*dinosaur* <../D/dinosaur.html>`__ parts carried terrific
angular momentum; the combination of a misaligned spindle or worn
bearings and stick-slip interactions with the floor could cause them to
‘walk’ across a room, lurching alternate corners forward a couple of
millimeters at a time. There is a legend about a drive that walked over
to the only door to the computer room and jammed it shut; the staff had
to cut a hole in the wall in order to get at it! Walking could also be
induced by certain patterns of drive access (a fast seek across the
whole width of the disk, followed by a slow seek in the other
direction). Some bands of old-time hackers figured out how to induce
disk-accessing patterns that would do this to particular drive models
and held disk-drive races.

--------------

**wall follower**: n.

A person or algorithm that compensates for lack of sophistication or
native stupidity by efficiently following some simple procedure shown to
have been effective in the past. Used of an algorithm, this is not
necessarily pejorative; it recalls ‘Harvey Wallbanger’, the winning
robot in an early AI contest (named, of course, after the cocktail).
Harvey successfully solved mazes by keeping a ‘finger’ on one wall and
running till it came out the other end. This was inelegant, but it was
mathematically guaranteed to work on simply-connected mazes — and, in
fact, Harvey outperformed more sophisticated robots that tried to
‘learn’ each maze by building an internal representation of it. Used of
humans, the term *is* pejorative and implies an uncreative,
bureaucratic, by-the-book mentality. See also `*code

--------------

**wallhack**

A form of game cheat especially associated with first-person shooters
like Quake, in which the walls in the simulated maze or dungeon are
rendered transparent to the cheater. This gives the cheater normally
hidden information about the whereabouts of other players. Beyond
gaming, a wallhack is the paradigm case of a whole class of security
problems that stem from the fact that a server cannot trust client
software, and server authors must assume that all computation farmed out
to a client is exposed to and can be interfered with by the user.

[WPI]

1. An indication of confusion, usually spoken with a quizzical tone:
“Wall??”

2. A request for further explication. Compare `*octal
forty* <../O/octal-forty.html>`__.

3. [Unix, from ‘write all’] v. To send a message to everyone currently
logged in, esp. with the wall(8) utility.

It is said that sense 1 came from the idiom ‘like talking to a blank
wall’. It was originally used in situations where, after you had
carefully answered a question, the questioner stared at you blankly,
clearly having understood nothing that was explained. You would then
throw out a “Hello, wall?” to elicit some sort of response from the
questioner. Later, confused questioners began voicing “Wall?”
themselves.

**wank**: /wangk/, n.,v.,adj.

[Columbia University: prob.: by mutation from Commonwealth slang v.
wank, to masturbate] Used much as `*hack* <../H/hack.html>`__ is
elsewhere, as a noun denoting a clever technique or person or the result
of such cleverness. May describe (negatively) the act of hacking for
hacking's sake (“Quit wanking, let's go get supper!”) or (more
positively) a `*wizard* <wizard.html>`__. Adj. wanky describes something
particularly clever (a person, program, or algorithm). Conversations can
also get wanky when there are too many wanks involved. This excess
wankiness is signalled by an overload of the wankometer (compare
`*bogometer* <../B/bogometer.html>`__). When the wankometer overloads,
the conversation's subject must be changed, or all non-wanks will leave.
Compare neep-neeping (under `*neep-neep* <../N/neep-neep.html>`__).
Usage: U.S. only. In Britain and the Commonwealth this word is
*extremely* rude and is best avoided unless one intends to give offense.
Adjectival wanky is less offensive and simply means ‘stupid’ or ‘broken’
(this is mainstream in Great Britain).

wannabee

 `Next <war-dialer.html>`__

--------------

**wannabee**: /won'@·bee/, n.

(also, more plausibly, spelled wannabe) [from a term recently used to
describe Madonna fans who dress, talk, and act like their idol; prob.:
originally from biker slang] A would-be `*hacker* <../H/hacker.html>`__.
The connotations of this term differ sharply depending on the age and
exposure of the subject. Used of a person who is in or might be entering
`*larval stage* <../L/larval-stage.html>`__, it is semi-approving; such
wannabees can be annoying but most hackers remember that they, too, were
once such creatures. When used of any professional programmer, CS
academic, writer, or `*suit* <../S/suit.html>`__, it is derogatory,
implying that said person is trying to cuddle up to the hacker mystique
but doesn't, fundamentally, have a prayer of understanding what it is
all about. Overuse of terms from this lexicon is often an indication of
the `*wannabee* <wannabee.html>`__ nature. Compare
`*newbie* <../N/newbie.html>`__.

Historical note: The wannabee phenomenon has a slightly different flavor
now (1993) than it did ten or fifteen years ago. When the people who are
now hackerdom's tribal elders were in `*larval
stage* <../L/larval-stage.html>`__, the process of becoming a hacker was
largely unconscious and unaffected by models known in popular culture —
communities formed spontaneously around people who, *as individuals*,
felt irresistibly drawn to do hackerly things, and what wannabees
experienced was a fairly pure, skill-focused desire to become similarly
wizardly. Those days of innocence are gone forever; society's adaptation
to the advent of the microcomputer after 1980 included the elevation of
the hacker as a new kind of folk hero, and the result is that some
people semi-consciously set out to *be hackers* and borrow hackish
prestige by fitting the popular image of hackers. Fortunately, to do
this really well, one has to actually become a wizard. Nevertheless,
old-time hackers tend to share a poorly articulated disquiet about the
change; among other things, it gives them mixed feelings about the
effects of public compendia of lore like this one.

    Warez d00dz get illegal copies of copyrighted software. If it has
    copy protection on it, they break the protection so the software can
    be copied. Then they distribute it around the world via several
    gateways. Warez d00dz form badass group names like RAZOR and the
    like. They put up boards that distribute the latest ware, or pirate
    program. The whole point of the Warez sub-culture is to get the
    pirate program released and distributed before any other group. I
    know, I know. But don't ask, and it won't hurt as much. This is how
    they prove their poweress [sic]. It gives them the right to say, “I
    released King's Quest IVXIX before you so obviously my testicles are
    larger.” Again don't ask...

The studly thing to do if one is a warez d00d, it appears, is emit 0-day
warez, that is copies of commercial software copied and cracked on the
same day as its retail release. Warez d00ds also hoard software in a big
way, collecting untold megabytes of arcade-style games, pornographic
JPGs, and applications they'll never use onto their hard disks. As Ozone
Pilot acutely observes:

    [BELONG] is the only word you will need to know. Warez d00dz want to
    belong. They have been shunned by everyone, and thus turn to
    cyberspace for acceptance. That is why they always start groups like
    TGW, FLT, USA and the like. Structure makes them happy. [...] Warez
    d00dz will never have a handle like “Pink Daisy” because warez d00dz
    are insecure. Only someone who is very secure with a good dose of
    self-esteem can stand up to the cries of fag and girlie-man. More
    likely you will find warez d00dz with handles like: Doctor Death,
    Deranged Lunatic, Hellraiser, Mad Prince, Dreamdevil, The Unknown,
    Renegade Chemist, Terminator, and Twin Turbo. They like to sound
    badass when they can hide behind their terminals. More likely, if
    you were given a sample of 100 people, the person whose handle is
    Hellraiser is the last person you'd associate with the name.

particularly large and obnoxious ASCII graphic resembling the sword of
Conan the Barbarian in the 1981 John Milius movie; the group name

1. Old-style 14-inch hard disks in floor-standing cabinets. So called
because of the size of the cabinet and the ‘top-loading’ access to the
media packs — and, of course, they were always set on ‘spin cycle’. The
washing-machine idiom transcends language barriers; it is even used in
Russian hacker jargon. See also `*walking
drives* <walking-drives.html>`__. The thick channel cables connecting
these were called bit hoses (see `*hose* <../H/hose.html>`__, sense 3).

wedged

**wedged**: adj.

1. To be stuck, incapable of proceeding without help. This is different
from having crashed. If the system has crashed, it has become totally
non-functioning. If the system is wedged, it is trying to do something
but cannot make progress; it may be capable of doing a few things, but
not be fully operational. For example, a process may become wedged if it
`*deadlock* <../D/deadlock.html>`__\ s with another (but not all
instances of wedging are deadlocks). See also
`*gronk* <../G/gronk.html>`__, `*locked up* <../L/locked-up.html>`__,
`*hosed* <../H/hosed.html>`__, `*hung* <../H/hung.html>`__ (wedged is
more severe than `*hung* <../H/hung.html>`__).

2. Often refers to humans suffering misconceptions. “He's totally wedged
— he's convinced that he can levitate through meditation.”

3. [Unix] Specifically used to describe the state of a TTY left in a
losing state by abort of a screen-oriented program or one that has
messed with the line discipline in some obscure way.

There is some dispute over the origin of this term. It is usually
thought to derive from a common description of recto-cranial inversion;
however, it may actually have originated with older ‘hot-press’ printing
technology in which physical type elements were locked into type frames
with wedges driven in by mallets. Once this had been done, no changes in
the typesetting for that page could be made.

`*BBS* <../B/BBS.html>`__ systems. The typical weenie is a teenage boy
with poor social skills travelling under a grandiose

2. [among hackers] When used with a qualifier (for example, as in `*Unix
weenie* <../U/Unix-weenie.html>`__, VMS weenie, IBM weenie) this can be
either an insult or a term of praise, depending on context, tone of
voice, and whether or not it is applied by a person who considers him or
herself to be the same sort of weenie. Implies that the weenie has put a
major investment of time, effort, and concentration into the area
indicated; whether this is good or bad depends on the hearer's judgment
of how the speaker feels about that area. See also
`*bigot* <../B/bigot.html>`__.

ex-ITSer, it is “the operating system preferred by Unix Weenies:

**wheel of reincarnation**

[coined in a paper by T.H. Myer and I.E. Sutherland *On the Design of
Display Processors*, Comm. ACM, Vol. 11, no. 6, June 1968)] Term used to
refer to a well-known effect whereby function in a computing system
family is migrated out to special-purpose peripheral hardware for speed,
then the peripheral evolves toward more computing power as it does its
job, then somebody notices that it is inefficient to support two
asymmetrical processors in the architecture and folds the function back
into the main CPU, at which point the cycle begins again.

Several iterations of this cycle have been observed in
graphics-processor design, and at least one or two in communications and
floating-point processors. Also known as the Wheel of Life, the Wheel of
Samsara, and other variations of the basic Hindu/Buddhist theological
idea. See also `*blitter* <../B/blitter.html>`__.

**Whorfian mind-lock**

[from the Lojban-language list] Software designs are often restricted in
unavoidable ways by the capacities of the operating system or hardware
they have to work with. Sometimes they are restricted in avoidable ways
by mental habits a developer has picked up from a particular language or
environment (perhaps a now-obsolete one) and never discarded. When a
design develops complications that are the result of a mental habit that
is no longer adaptive, the developer has succumbed to Whorfian
mind-lock. The design itself has been ‘whorfed’.

For example, some Unix designs are whorfed by the assumption that
directory searches are linear and expensive for large directories;
therefore directories must be kept small. Another common way to succumb
to Whorfian mind-lock is to do serial processing with a small working
set rather than slurping an entire file or data structure into memory;
the hidden assumption here is that not much core is available and
virtual memory works poorly if at all. Detecting Whorfian mind-lock is
important, because it tends to introduce unnecessary complexity and
bugs.

stable (though inaccurate) wiggles can be generated near a discontinuity

weight of the charge). (It is sometimes incorrectly claimed that
Winchester was the laboratory in which the technology was developed.)

**win**

[MIT; now common everywhere]

1. vi. To succeed. A program wins if no unexpected conditions arise, or
(especially) if it is sufficiently `*robust* <../R/robust.html>`__ to
take exceptions in stride.

2. n. Success, or a specific instance thereof. A pleasing outcome. “So
it turned out I could use a `*lexer* <../L/lexer.html>`__ generator
instead of hand-coding my own pattern recognizer. What a win!” Emphatic
forms: moby win, super win, hyper-win (often used interjectively as a
reply). For some reason suitable win is also common at MIT, usually in
reference to a satisfactory solution to a problem. Oppose
`*lose* <../L/lose.html>`__; see also `*big win* <../B/big-win.html>`__,
which isn't quite just an intensification of win.

1. Transitively, a person who knows how a complex piece of software or
hardware works (that is, who `*grok* <../G/grok.html>`__\ s it); esp.
someone who can find and fix bugs quickly in an emergency. Someone is a
`*hacker* <../H/hacker.html>`__ if he or she has general hacking
ability, but is a wizard with respect to something only if he or she has
specific detailed knowledge of that thing. A good hacker could become a
wizard for something given the time to study it.

2. The term ‘wizard’ is also used intransitively of someone who has
extremely high-level hacking or problem-solving ability.

3. A person who is permitted to do things forbidden to ordinary people;
one who has `*wheel* <wheel.html>`__ privileges on a system.

4. A Unix expert, esp. a Unix systems programmer. This usage is well
enough established that ‘Unix Wizard’ is a recognized job title at some
corporations and to most headhunters.

different routine. This term is now obsolescent; modern operating
systems use clusters of wormholes extensively (for modularization of I/O
handling in particular, as in the Unix device-driver organization) but
the preferred techspeak for these clusters is ‘device tables’, ‘jump
tables’ or ‘capability tables’.

2. [Amateur Packet Radio] A network path using a commercial satellite
link to join two or more amateur VHF networks. So called because traffic
routed through a wormhole leaves and re-enters the amateur network over
great distances with usually little clue in the message routing header
as to how it got from one relay to the other. Compare `*gopher
hole* <../G/gopher-hole.html>`__ (sense 2).

[from tapeworm in John Brunner's novel *The Shockwave Rider*, via XEROX
PARC] A program that propagates itself over a network, reproducing
itself as it goes. Compare `*virus* <../V/virus.html>`__. Nowadays the
term has negative connotations, as it is assumed that only
`*cracker* <../C/cracker.html>`__\ s write worms. Perhaps the best-known
example was Robert T. Morris's `*Great Worm* <../G/Great-Worm.html>`__

1. [techspeak] The action of a counter that starts over at zero or at
minus infinity (see `*infinity* <../I/infinity.html>`__) after its
maximum value has been reached, and continues incrementing, either
because it is programmed to do so or because of an overflow (as when a
car's odometer starts over at 0).

2. To change `*phase* <../P/phase.html>`__ gradually and continuously by
maintaining a steady wake-sleep cycle somewhat longer than 24 hours,
e.g., living six long (28-hour) days in a week (or, equivalently,
sleeping at the rate of 10 microhertz). This sense is also called
`*phase-wrapping* <../P/phase-wrapping.html>`__.

--------------

**write-only memory**: n.

The obvious antonym to read-only memory. Out of frustration with the
long and seemingly useless chain of approvals required of component
specifications, during which no actual checking seemed to occur, an
engineer at Signetics once created a specification for a write-only
memory and included it with a bunch of other specifications to be
approved. This inclusion came to the attention of Signetics
`*management* <../M/management.html>`__ only when regular customers
started calling and asking for pricing information. Signetics published
a corrected edition of the data book and requested the return of the
‘erroneous’ ones. Later, in 1972, Signetics bought a double-page spread
in *Electronics* magazine's April issue and used the spec as an April
Fools' Day joke. Instead of the more conventional characteristic curves,
the 25120 “fully encoded, 9046 x N, Random Access, write-only-memory”
data sheet included diagrams of “bit capacity vs.: Temp.”, “Iff vs.
Vff”, “Number of pins remaining vs.: number of socket insertions”, and
“AQL vs.: selling price”. The 25120 required a 6.3 VAC VFF supply, a
+10V VCC, and VDD of 0V, ``±2%``.

**Wrong Thing**: n.

A design, action, or decision that is clearly incorrect or
inappropriate. Often capitalized; always emphasized in speech as if
capitalized. The opposite of the `*Right
Thing* <../R/Right-Thing.html>`__; more generally, anything that is not
the Right Thing. In cases where ‘the good is the enemy of the best’, the
merely good — although good — is nevertheless the Wrong Thing. “In C,
the default is for module-level declarations to be visible everywhere,
rather than just within the module. This is clearly the Wrong Thing.”

**wumpus**: /wuhm´p@s/, n.

The central monster (and, in many versions, the name) of a famous family
of very early computer games called *Hunt The Wumpus*. The original was
invented in 1970 (several years before `*ADVENT* <../A/ADVENT.html>`__)
by Gregory Yob. The wumpus lived somewhere in a cave with the topology
of an dodecahedron's edge/vertex graph (later versions supported other
topologies, including an icosahedron and Möbius strip). The player
started somewhere at random in the cave with five ‘crooked arrows’;
these could be shot through up to three connected rooms, and would kill
the wumpus on a hit (later versions introduced the wounded wumpus, which
got very angry). Unfortunately for players, the movement necessary to
map the maze was made hazardous not merely by the wumpus (which would
eat you if you stepped on him) but also by bottomless pits and colonies
of super bats that would pick you up and drop you at a random location
(later versions added ‘anaerobic termites’ that ate arrows, bat
migrations, and earthquakes that randomly changed pit locations).

This game appears to have been the first to use a non-random
graph-structured map (as opposed to a rectangular grid like the even
older Star Trek games). In this respect, as in the dungeon-like setting
and its terse, amusing messages, it prefigured
`*ADVENT* <../A/ADVENT.html>`__ and `*Zork* <../Z/Zork.html>`__ and was
directly ancestral to the latter (Zork acknowledged this heritage by
including a super-bat colony). A C emulation of the original Basic game
is available at the Retrocomputing Museum,
`http://www.catb.org/retro/ <http://www.catb.org/retro/>`__.

WYSIAYG

--------------

**WYSIAYG**: /wiz´ee·ayg/, adj.

Describes a user interface under which “What You See Is *All* You Get”;
an unhappy variant of `*WYSIWYG* <WYSIWYG.html>`__. Visual,
‘point-and-shoot’-style interfaces tend to have easy initial learning
curves, but also to lack depth; they often frustrate advanced users who
would be better served by a command-style interface. When this happens,
the frustrated user has a WYSIAYG problem. This term is most often used
of editors, word processors, and document formatting programs. WYSIWYG
‘desktop publishing’ programs, for example, are a clear win for creating
small documents with lots of fonts and graphics in them, especially
things like newsletters and presentation slides. When typesetting
book-length manuscripts, on the other hand, scale changes the nature of
the task; one quickly runs into WYSIAYG limitations, and the increased
power and flexibility of a command-driven formatter like
`*TeX* <../T/TeX.html>`__ or Unix's `*troff* <../T/troff.html>`__
becomes not just desirable but a necessity. Compare
`*YAFIYGI* <../Y/YAFIYGI.html>`__.

--------------

**WYSIWYG**: /wiz´ee·wig/, /wiss´ee·wig/, adj.

[Traced to Flip Wilson's “Geraldine” character c.1970] Describes a user
interface under which “What You See Is What You Get”, as opposed to one
that uses more-or-less obscure commands that do not result in immediate
visual feedback. True WYSIWYG in environments supporting multiple fonts
or graphics is a rarely-attained ideal; there are variants of this term
to express real-world manifestations including WYSIAWYG (What You See Is
*Almost* What You Get) and WYSIMOLWYG (What You See Is More or Less What
You Get). All these can be mildly derogatory, as they are often used to
refer to dumbed-down `*user-friendly* <../U/user-friendly.html>`__
interfaces targeted at non-programmers; a hacker has no fear of obscure
commands (compare `*WYSIAYG* <WYSIAYG.html>`__). On the other hand,
`*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__ was one of the very first WYSIWYG editors,
replacing (actually, at first overlaying) the extremely obscure,
command-based `*TECO* <../T/TECO.html>`__. See also `*WIMP
environment* <WIMP-environment.html>`__. [Oddly enough, WYSIWYG made it
into the 1986 supplement to the OED, in lower case yet. —ESR]
