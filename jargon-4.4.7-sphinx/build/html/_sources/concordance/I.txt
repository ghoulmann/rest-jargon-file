**IBM**: /I·B·M/

Once upon a time, the computer company most hackers loved to hate;
today, the one they are most puzzled to find themselves liking.

From hackerdom's beginnings in the mid-1960s to the early 1990s, IBM was
regarded with active loathing. Common expansions of the corporate name
included: Inferior But Marketable; It's Better Manually; Insidious Black
Magic; It's Been Malfunctioning; Incontinent Bowel Movement; and a
near-`*infinite* <infinite.html>`__ number of even less complimentary
expansions (see also `*fear and
loathing* <../F/fear-and-loathing.html>`__). What galled hackers about
most IBM machines above the PC level wasn't so much that they were
underpowered and overpriced (though that counted against them), but that
the designs were incredibly archaic, `*crufty* <../C/crufty.html>`__,
and `*elephantine* <../E/elephantine.html>`__ ... and you couldn't *fix*
them — source code was locked up tight, and programming tools were
expensive, hard to find, and bletcherous to use once you had found them.

We didn't know how good we had it back then. In the 1980s IBM had its
own troubles with Microsoft and lost its strategic way, receding from
the hacker community's view. Then, in the 1990s, Microsoft became more
noxious and omnipresent than IBM had ever been.

In the late 1990s IBM re-invented itself as a services company, began to
release open-source software through its AlphaWorks group, and began
shipping `*Linux* <../L/Linux.html>`__ systems and building ties to the
Linux community. To the astonishment of all parties, IBM emerged as a
staunch friend of the hacker community and `*open
source* <../O/open-source.html>`__ development, with ironic consequences
noted in the `*FUD* <../F/FUD.html>`__ entry.

This lexicon includes a number of entries attributed to ‘IBM’; these
derive from some rampantly unofficial jargon lists circulated within
IBM's formerly beleaguered hacker underground.

--------------

**ICBM address**: n.

(Also missile address) The form used to register a site with the Usenet
mapping project, back before the day of pervasive Internet, included a
blank for longitude and latitude, preferably to seconds-of-arc accuracy.
This was actually used for generating geographically-correct maps of
Usenet links on a plotter; however, it became traditional to refer to
this as one's ICBM address or missile address, and some people include
it in their `*sig block* <../S/sig-block.html>`__ with that name. (A
real missile address would include target elevation.)

**ice**: n.

[coined by Usenetter Tom Maddox, popularized by William Gibson's
cyberpunk SF novels: a contrived acronym for ‘Intrusion Countermeasure
Electronics’] Security software (in Gibson's novels, software that
responds to intrusion by attempting to immobilize or even literally kill
the intruder). Hence, icebreaker: a program designed for cracking
security on a system.

Neither term is in serious use yet as of late 2003, but many hackers
find the metaphor attractive, and each may develop a denotation in the
future. In the meantime, the speculative usage could be confused with
‘ICE’, an acronym for “in-circuit emulator”.

In ironic reference to the speculative usage, however, some hackers and
computer scientists formed ICE (International Cryptographic Experiment)
in 1994. ICE is a consortium to promote uniform international access to
strong cryptography.

**idempotent**: adj.

[from mathematical techspeak] Acting as if used only once, even if used
multiple times. This term is often used with respect to
`*C* <../C/C.html>`__ header files, which contain common definitions and
declarations to be included by several source files. If a header file is
ever included twice during the same compilation (perhaps due to nested
#include files), compilation errors can result unless the header file
has protected itself against multiple inclusion; a header file so
protected is said to be idempotent. The term can also be used to
describe an initialization subroutine that is arranged to perform some
critical action exactly once, even if the routine is called several
times.

on an unrelated systems software change, for example a divide-by-0 fault

“If you want PL/I, you know where to find it.” Ever since, this has been

**ill-behaved**: adj.

1. [numerical analysis] Said of an algorithm or computational method
that tends to blow up because of accumulated roundoff error or poor
convergence properties.

2. [obs.] Software that bypasses the defined `*OS* <../O/OS.html>`__
interfaces to do things (like screen, keyboard, and disk I/O) itself,
often in a way that depends on the hardware of the machine it is running
on or which is nonportable or incompatible with other pieces of
software. In the MS-DOS world, there was a folk theorem (nearly true) to
the effect that (owing to gross inadequacies and performance penalties
in the OS interface) all interesting applications were ill-behaved. See
also `*bare metal* <../B/bare-metal.html>`__. Oppose
`*well-behaved* <../W/well-behaved.html>`__. See also
`*mess-dos* <../M/mess-dos.html>`__.

3. In modern usage, a program is called ill-behaved if it uses
interfaces to the OS or other programs that are private, undocumented,
or grossly non-portable. Another way to be ill-behaved is to use headers
or files that are theoretically private to another application.

[Usenet] Since `*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__ first got off the ground

every year. On the other hand, most people feel the `*signal-to-noise

steadily. These trends led, as far back as mid-1983, to predictions of
the imminent collapse (or death) of the net. Ten years and numerous
doublings later, enough of these gloomy prognostications have been
confounded that the phrase “Imminent Death Of The Net Predicted!” has
become a running joke, hauled out any time someone grumbles about the
`*S/N ratio* <../S/S-N-ratio.html>`__ or the huge and steadily
increasing volume, or the possible loss of a key node or link, or the
potential for lawsuits when ignoramuses post copyrighted material, etc.,

**indent style**: n.

[C, C++, and Java programmers] The rules one uses to indent code in a
readable fashion. There are four major C indent styles, described below;
all have the aim of making it easier for the reader to visually track
the scope of control constructs. They have been inherited by C++ and
Java, which have C-like syntaxes. The significant variable is the
placement of ``{`` and ``}`` with respect to the statement(s) they
enclose and to the guard or controlling statement (**if**, **else**,
**for**, **while**, or **do**) on the block, if any.

K&R style — Named after Kernighan & Ritchie, because the examples in
`*K&R* <../K/K-ampersand-R.html>`__ are formatted this way. Also called
kernel style because the Unix kernel is written in it, and the ‘One True
Brace Style’ (abbrev. 1TBS) by its partisans. In C code, the body is
typically indented by eight spaces (or one tab) per level, as shown
here. Four spaces are occasionally seen in C, but in C++ and Java four
tends to be the rule rather than the exception.

| 
|  if (<cond>) {
|          <body>
|  }

Allman style — Named for Eric Allman, a Berkeley hacker who wrote a lot
of the BSD utilities in it (it is sometimes called BSD style). Resembles
normal indent style in Pascal and Algol. It is the only style other than
K&R in widespread use among Java programmers. Basic indent per level
shown here is eight spaces, but four (or sometimes three) spaces are
generally preferred by C++ and Java programmers.

| 
|  if (<cond>)
|  {
|          <body>
|  }

Whitesmiths style — popularized by the examples that came with
Whitesmiths C, an early commercial C compiler. Basic indent per level
shown here is eight spaces, but four spaces are occasionally seen.

| 
|  if (<cond>)
|          {
|          <body>
|          }

GNU style — Used throughout GNU EMACS and the Free Software Foundation
code, and just about nowhere else. Indents are always four spaces per
level, with **{** and **}** halfway between the outer and inner indent
levels.

| 
|  if (<cond>)
|    {
|      <body>
|    }

Surveys have shown the Allman and Whitesmiths styles to be the most
common, with about equal mind shares. K&R/1TBS used to be nearly
universal, but is now much less common in C (the opening brace tends to
get lost against the right paren of the guard part in an **if** or
**while**, which is a `*Bad Thing* <../B/Bad-Thing.html>`__). Defenders
of 1TBS argue that any putative gain in readability is less important
than their style's relative economy with vertical space, which enables
one to see more code on one's screen at once. The Java Language
Specification legislates not only the capitalization of identifiers, but
where nouns, adjectives, and verbs should be in method, class,
interface, and variable names (section 6.8). While the specification
stops short of also standardizing on a bracing style, all source code
originating from Sun Laboratories uses the K&R style. This has set a
precedent for Java programmers, which most follow.

Doubtless these issues will continue to be the subject of `*holy
wars* <../H/holy-wars.html>`__.

components has accumulated for the machine to start going senile). Up to
half of all chip and wire failures happen within a new system's first
few weeks; such failures are often referred to as infant mortality
problems (or, occasionally, as sudden infant death syndrome). See

Infinite-Monkey Theorem

--------------

**Infinite-Monkey Theorem**: n.

“If you put an `*infinite* <infinite.html>`__ number of monkeys at
typewriters, eventually one will bash out the script for Hamlet.” (One
may also hypothesize a small number of monkeys and a very long period of
time.) This theorem asserts nothing about the intelligence of the one
`*random* <../R/random.html>`__ monkey that eventually comes up with the
script (and note that the mob will also type out all the possible
*incorrect* versions of Hamlet). It may be referred to semi-seriously
when justifying a `*brute force* <../B/brute-force.html>`__ method; the
implication is that, with enough resources thrown at it, any technical
challenge becomes a `*one-banana
problem* <../O/one-banana-problem.html>`__. This argument gets more
respect since `*Linux* <../L/Linux.html>`__ justified the
`*bazaar* <../B/bazaar.html>`__ mode of development.

Other hackers maintain that the Infinite-Monkey Theorem cannot be true —
otherwise Usenet would have reproduced the entire canon of great
literature by now.

In mid-2002, researchers at Plymouth Univesity in England actually put a
working computer in a cage with six crested macaques. The monkeys
proceeded to bash the machine with a rock, urinate on it, and type the
letter S a lot (later, the letters A, J, L, and M also crept in). The
results were published in a limited-edition book, *Notes Towards The
Complete Works of Shakespeare*. A researcher reported: “They were quite
interested in the screen, and they saw that when they typed a letter,
something happened. There was a level of intention there.” Scattered
field reports that there are AOL users this competent have been greeted
with well-deserved skepticism.

This theorem has been traced to the mathematiciamn Émile Borel in 1913,
and was first popularized by the astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington. It
became part of the idiom of techies via the classic SF short story
`Inflexible Logic <http://www.janda.org/c10/readings/monkeys.htm>`__ by
Russell Maloney, and many younger hackers know it through a reference in
Douglas Adams's *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*. Some other
references have been `collected on the
Web <http://www.angelfire.com/in/hypnosonic/Parable_of_the_Monkeys.html>`__.
On 1 April 2000 the usage acquired its own Internet standard,
`RFC2795 <%20%20%20%20http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2795.txt>`__ (Infinite
Monkey Protocol Suite).

1. The largest value that can be represented in a particular type of

2. minus infinity: The smallest such value, not necessarily or even
usually the simple negation of plus infinity. In ``N``-bit
twos-complement arithmetic, infinity is ``2N-1 -    1`` but minus
infinity is ``-    (2N-1)``, not ``-(2N-1 - 1)``. Note also that this is
different from time T equals minus infinity, which is closer to a
mathematician's usage of infinity.

A now-legendary games company, active from 1979 to 1989, that
commercialized the MDL parser technology used for
`*Zork* <../Z/Zork.html>`__ to produce a line of text adventure games
that remain favorites among hackers. Infocom's games were intelligent,
funny, witty, erudite, irreverent, challenging, satirical, and most
thoroughly hackish in spirit. The physical game packages from Infocom
are now prized collector's items. After being acquired by Activision in
1989 they did a few more “modern” (e.g. graphics-intensive) games which
were less successful than reissues of their classics.

The software, thankfully, is still extant; Infocom games were written in
a kind of P-code (called, actually, z-code) and distributed with a
P-code interpreter core, and not only open-source emulators for that
interpreter but an actual compiler as well have been written to permit
the P-code to be run on platforms the games never originally graced. In
fact, new games written in this P-code are still being written. There is
a home page at
`http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/ <http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/>`__, and
it is even possible to play these games in your

INTERCAL

`Prev <installfest.html>`__ 

I

 `Next <InterCaps.html>`__

--------------

**INTERCAL**: /in´t@r·kal/, n.

[said by the authors to stand for Compiler Language With No
Pronounceable Acronym] A computer language designed by Don Woods and
James Lyons in 1972. INTERCAL is purposely different from all other
computer languages in all ways but one; it is purely a written language,
being totally unspeakable. An excerpt from the INTERCAL Reference Manual
will make the style of the language clear:

    It is a well-known and oft-demonstrated fact that a person whose
    work is incomprehensible is held in high esteem. For example, if one
    were to state that the simplest way to store a value of 65536 in a
    32-bit INTERCAL variable is:

    | 
    |  DO :1 <- #0$#256

    any sensible programmer would say that that was absurd. Since this
    is indeed the simplest method, the programmer would be made to look
    foolish in front of his boss, who would of course have happened to
    turn up, as bosses are wont to do. The effect would be no less
    devastating for the programmer having been correct.

INTERCAL has many other peculiar features designed to make it even more
unspeakable. The Woods-Lyons implementation was actually used by many
(well, at least several) people at Princeton. The language has been
recently reimplemented as C-INTERCAL and is consequently enjoying an
unprecedented level of unpopularity; there is even an
``alt.lang.intercal`` newsgroup devoted to the study and ...
appreciation of the language on Usenet.

Inevitably, INTERCAL has a home page on the Web:
`http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ <http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/>`__.
An extended version, implemented in (what else?)
`*Perl* <../P/Perl.html>`__ and adding object-oriented features, is
rumored to exist. See also `*Befunge* <../B/Befunge.html>`__.

**Internet**: n.

The mother of all networks. First incarnated beginning in 1969 as the
ARPANET, a U.S. Department of Defense research testbed. Though it has
been widely believed that the goal was to develop a network architecture
for military command-and-control that could survive disruptions up to
and including nuclear war, this is a myth; in fact, ARPANET was
conceived from the start as a way to get most economical use out of
then-scarce large-computer resources. Robert Herzfeld, who was director
of ARPA at the time, has been at some pains to debunk the
“survive-a-nuclear-war” myth, but it seems unkillable.

As originally imagined, ARPANET's major use would have been to support
what is now called remote login and more sophisticated forms of
distributed computing, but the infant technology of electronic mail
quickly grew to dominate actual usage. Universities, research labs and
defense contractors early discovered the Internet's potential as a
medium of communication between *humans* and linked up in steadily
increasing numbers, connecting together a quirky mix of academics,
techies, hippies, SF fans, hackers, and anarchists. The roots of this
lexicon lie in those early years.

Over the next quarter-century the Internet evolved in many ways. The
typical machine/OS combination moved from `*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__
`*PDP-10* <../P/PDP-10.html>`__\ s and
`*PDP-20* <../P/PDP-20.html>`__\ s, running
`*TOPS-10* <../T/TOPS-10.html>`__ and `*TOPS-20* <../T/TOPS-20.html>`__,
to PDP-11s and `*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__\ en and Suns running
`*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__, and in the 1990s to Unix on Intel
microcomputers. The Internet's protocols grew more capable, most notably
in the move from NCP/IP to `*TCP/IP* <../T/TCP-IP.html>`__ in 1982 and
the implementation of Domain Name Service in 1983. It was around this
time that people began referring to the collection of interconnected
networks with ARPANET at its core as “the Internet”.

The ARPANET had a fairly strict set of participation guidelines --
connected institutions had to be involved with a DOD-related research
project. By the mid-80s, many of the organizations clamoring to join
didn't fit this profile. In 1986, the National Science Foundation built
NSFnet to open up access to its five regional supercomputing centers;
NSFnet became the backbone of the Internet, replacing the original
ARPANET pipes (which were formally shut down in 1990). Between 1990 and
late 1994 the pieces of NSFnet were sold to major telecommunications
companies until the Internet backbone had gone completely commercial.

That year, 1994, was also the year the mainstream culture discovered the
Internet. Once again, the `*killer app* <../K/killer-app.html>`__ was
not the anticipated one — rather, what caught the public imagination was
the hypertext and multimedia features of the World Wide Web.
Subsequently the Internet has seen off its only serious challenger (the
OSI protocol stack favored by European telecoms monopolies) and is in
the process of absorbing into itself many of the proprietary networks
built during the second wave of wide-area networking after 1980. By 1996
it had become a commonplace even in mainstream media to predict that a
globally-extended Internet would become the key unifying communications
technology of the next century. See also `*the
network* <../T/the-network.html>`__.

--------------

**IRC**: /I·R·C/, n.

[Internet Relay Chat] A worldwide “party line” network that allows one
to converse with others in real time. IRC is structured as a network of
Internet servers, each of which accepts connections from client
programs, one per user. The IRC community and the
`*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__ and `*MUD* <../M/MUD.html>`__
communities overlap to some extent, including both hackers and regular
folks who have discovered the wonders of computer networks. Some Usenet
jargon has been adopted on IRC, as have some conventions such as
`*emoticon* <../E/emoticon.html>`__\ s. There is also a vigorous native
jargon, represented in this lexicon by entries marked ‘[IRC]’. See also
`*talk mode* <../T/talk-mode.html>`__.

**Iron Age**: n.

In the history of computing, 1961-1971 — the formative era of commercial
`*mainframe* <../M/mainframe.html>`__ technology, when ferrite-core
`*dinosaur* <../D/dinosaur.html>`__\ s ruled the earth. The Iron Age
began, ironically enough, with the delivery of the first minicomputer
(the PDP-1) and ended with the introduction of the first commercial
microprocessor (the Intel 4004) in 1971. See also `*Stone

--------------

**I see no X here.**

Hackers (and the interactive computer games they write) traditionally
favor this slightly marked usage over other possible equivalents such as
“There's no X here!” or “X is missing.” or “Where's the X?”. This goes
back to the original PDP-10 `*ADVENT* <../A/ADVENT.html>`__, which would
respond in this wise if you asked it to do something involving an object
not present at your location in the game.

ISO standard cup of tea

`Prev <ironmonger.html>`__ 

I

--------------

**ISO standard cup of tea**: n.

[South Africa] A cup of tea with milk and one teaspoon of sugar, where
the milk is poured into the cup before the tea. Variations are ISO 0,
with no sugar; ISO 2, with two spoons of sugar; and so on.

This may derive from the “NATO standard” cup of coffee and tea (milk and
two sugars), military slang going back to the late 1950s and parodying
NATO's relentless bureaucratic drive to standardize parts across
European and U.S. militaries.

Like many ISO standards, this one has a faintly alien ring in North
America, where hackers generally shun the decadent British practice of
adulterating perfectly good tea with dairy products and prefer instead
to add a wedge of lemon, if anything. If one were feeling extremely
silly, one might hypothesize an analogous ANSI standard cup of tea and
wind up with a political situation distressingly similar to several that
arise in much more serious technical contexts. (Milk and lemon don't mix
very well.)

[2000 update: There is now, in fact, an ISO standard 3103: ‘Method for
preparation of a liquor of tea for use in sensory tests.’, alleged to be
equivalent to British Standard BS6008: *How to make a standard cup of
tea.* —ESR]

--------------

**ISP**: /I·S·P/

Common abbreviation for Internet Service Provider, a kind of company
that barely existed before 1993. ISPs sell Internet access to the mass
market. While the big nationwide commercial BBSs with Internet access
(like America Online, CompuServe, GEnie, Netcom, etc.) are technically
ISPs, the term is usually reserved for local or regional small providers
(often run by hackers turned entrepreneurs) who resell Internet access
cheaply without themselves being information providers or selling
advertising. Compare `*NSP* <../N/NSP.html>`__.

**Itanic**: n.

The Intel Itanium, so called in reference to the legendary disaster that
was the Titanic. This term bubbled up in several places on the Internet
in 1999 when it was beginning to become clear that the Itanium was
turning into the most expensive and protracted flop in the history of
the semiconductor industry.

--------------

**ITS**: /I·T·S/, n.

1. Incompatible Time-sharing System, an influential though highly
idiosyncratic operating system written for PDP-6s and PDP-10s at MIT and
long used at the MIT AI Lab. Much AI-hacker jargon derives from ITS
folklore, and to have been ‘an ITS hacker’ qualifies one instantly as an
old-timer of the most venerable sort. ITS pioneered many important
innovations, including transparent file sharing between machines and
terminal-independent I/O. After about 1982, most actual work was shifted
to newer machines, with the remaining ITS boxes run essentially as a
hobby and service to the hacker community. The shutdown of the lab's
last ITS machine in May 1990 marked the end of an era and sent old-time
hackers into mourning nationwide (see `*high
moby* <../H/high-moby.html>`__). There is an `ITS home
page <http://www.its.os.org/>`__.

2. A mythical image of operating-system perfection worshiped by a
bizarre, fervent retro-cult of old-time hackers and ex-users (see
`*troglodyte* <../T/troglodyte.html>`__, sense 2). ITS worshipers manage
somehow to continue believing that an OS maintained by assembly-language
hand-hacking that supported only monocase 6-character filenames in one
directory per account remains superior to today's state of commercial
art (their venom against `*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__ is particularly
intense). See also `*holy wars* <../H/holy-wars.html>`__,
`*Weenix* <../W/Weenix.html>`__.
