--------------

**quadruple bucky**: n. obs.

1. On an MIT `*space-cadet
keyboard* <../S/space-cadet-keyboard.html>`__, use of all four of the
shifting keys (control, meta, hyper, and super) while typing a character
key.

2. On a Stanford or MIT keyboard in `*raw mode* <../R/raw-mode.html>`__,
use of four shift keys while typing a fifth character, where the four
shift keys are the control and meta keys on *both* sides of the
keyboard. This was very difficult to do! One accepted technique was to
press the left-control and left-meta keys with your left hand, the
right-control and right-meta keys with your right hand, and the fifth
key with your nose.

Quadruple-bucky combinations were very seldom used in practice, because
when one invented a new command one usually assigned it to some
character that was easier to type. If you want to imply that a program
has ridiculously many commands or features, you can say something like:
“Oh, the command that makes it spin the tapes while whistling
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is quadruple-bucky-cokebottle.” See `*double
bucky* <../D/double-bucky.html>`__, `*bucky
bits* <../B/bucky-bits.html>`__,

**quantifiers**

In techspeak and jargon, the standard metric prefixes used in the SI
(Système International) conventions for scientific measurement have dual
uses. With units of time or things that come in powers of 10, such as
money, they retain their usual meanings of multiplication by powers of
``1000 = 10^3``. But when used with bytes or other things that naturally
come in powers of 2, they usually denote multiplication by powers of
``1024 = 2^10``.

Here are the SI magnifying prefixes, along with the corresponding binary
interpretations in common use:

| 
|  prefix  decimal  binary
|  kilo-   1000^1   1024^1 = 2^10 = 1,024 
|  mega-   1000^2   1024^2 = 2^20 = 1,048,576 
|  giga-   1000^3   1024^3 = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 
|  tera-   1000^4   1024^4 = 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776 
|  peta-   1000^5   1024^5 = 2^50 = 1,125,899,906,842,624 
|  exa-    1000^6   1024^6 = 2^60 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 
|  zetta-  1000^7   1024^7 = 2^70 = 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 
|  yotta-  1000^8   1024^8 = 2^80 = 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 

Here are the SI fractional prefixes:

| 
|  prefix  decimal     jargon usage
|  milli-  1000^-1     (seldom used in jargon)
| 
micro-  1000^-2     small or human-scale (see \ `*micro-* <../M/micro-.html>`__)
| 
nano-   1000^-3     even smaller (see \ `*nano-* <../N/nano-.html>`__)
| 
pico-   1000^-4     even smaller yet (see \ `*pico-* <../P/pico-.html>`__)
|  femto-  1000^-5     (not used in jargon—yet)
|  atto-   1000^-6     (not used in jargon—yet)
|  zepto-  1000^-7     (not used in jargon—yet)
|  yocto-  1000^-8     (not used in jargon—yet)

The prefixes zetta-, yotta-, zepto-, and yocto- have been included in
these tables purely for completeness and giggle value; they were adopted
in 1990 by the *19th Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures*. The
binary peta- and exa- loadings, though well established, are not in
jargon use either — yet. The prefix milli-, denoting multiplication by
``1/1000``, has always been rare in jargon (there is, however, a
standard joke about the millihelen — notionally, the amount of beauty
required to launch one ship). See the entries on
`*micro-* <../M/micro-.html>`__, `*pico-* <../P/pico-.html>`__, and
`*nano-* <../N/nano-.html>`__ for more information on connotative jargon
use of these terms. ‘Femto’ and ‘atto’ (which, interestingly, derive not
from Greek but from Danish) have not yet acquired jargon loadings,
though it is easy to predict what those will be once computing
technology enters the required realms of magnitude (however, see
`*attoparsec* <../A/attoparsec.html>`__).

There are, of course, some standard unit prefixes for powers of 10. In
the following table, the ‘prefix’ column is the international standard
prefix for the appropriate power of ten; the ‘binary’ column lists
jargon abbreviations and words for the corresponding power of 2. The
B-suffixed forms are commonly used for byte quantities; the words ‘meg’
and ‘gig’ are nouns that may (but do not always) pluralize with ‘s’.

| 
|  prefix   decimal   binary       pronunciation}
|  kilo-       k      K, KB,       *kay*
|  mega-       M      M, MB, meg   *meg*
|  giga-       G      G, GB, gig   *gig*,\ *jig*

Confusingly, hackers often use K or M as though they were suffix or
numeric multipliers rather than a prefix; thus “2K dollars”, “2M of disk
space”. This is also true (though less commonly) of G.

Note that the formal SI metric prefix for 1000 is ‘k’; some use this
strictly, reserving ‘K’ for multiplication by 1024 (KB is thus
‘kilobytes’).

K, M, and G used alone refer to quantities of bytes; thus, 64G is 64
gigabytes and ‘a K’ is a kilobyte (compare mainstream use of ‘a G’ as
short for ‘a grand’, that is, $1000). Whether one pronounces ‘gig’ with
hard or soft ‘g’ depends on what one thinks the proper pronunciation of
‘giga-’ is.

Confusing 1000 and 1024 (or other powers of 2 and 10 close in magnitude)
— for example, describing a memory in units of 500K or 524K instead of
512K — is a sure sign of the `*marketroid* <../M/marketroid.html>`__.
One example of this: it is common to refer to the capacity of 3.5"
floppies as ‘1.44 MB’ In fact, this is a completely
`*bogus* <../B/bogus.html>`__ number. The correct size is 1440 KB, that
is, 1440 \* 1024 = 1474560 bytes. So the ‘mega’ in ‘1.44 MB’ is
compounded of two ‘kilos’, one of which is 1024 and the other of which
is 1000. The correct number of megabytes would of course be 1440 / 1024
= 1.40625. Alas, this fine point is probably lost on the world forever.
[1993 update: hacker Morgan Burke has proposed, to general approval on
Usenet, the following additional prefixes:

+-----------+----------+
| groucho   | 10^-30   |
+-----------+----------+
| harpo     | 10^-27   |
+-----------+----------+
| harpi     | 10^27    |
+-----------+----------+
| grouchi   | 10^30    |
+-----------+----------+

We observe that this would leave the prefixes zeppo-, gummo-, and chico-
available for future expansion. Sadly, there is little immediate
prospect that Mr. Burke's eminently sensible proposal will be ratified.]

quantum bogodynamics

`Prev <quantifiers.html>`__ 

Q

 `Next <quarter.html>`__

--------------

**quantum bogodynamics**: /kwon´tm boh\`goh·di:·nam´iks/, n.

A theory that characterizes the universe in terms of bogon sources (such
as politicians, used-car salesmen, TV evangelists, and
`*suit* <../S/suit.html>`__\ s in general), bogon sinks (such as
taxpayers and computers), and bogosity potential fields. Bogon
absorption, of course, causes human beings to behave mindlessly and
machines to fail (and may also cause both to emit secondary bogons);
however, the precise mechanics of the bogon-computron interaction are
not yet understood and remain to be elucidated. Quantum bogodynamics is
most often invoked to explain the sharp increase in hardware and
software failures in the presence of suits; the latter emit bogons,
which the former absorb. See `*bogon* <../B/bogon.html>`__,
`*computron* <../C/computron.html>`__, `*suit* <../S/suit.html>`__,
`*psyton* <../P/psyton.html>`__.

Here is a representative QBD theory: The bogon is a boson (integral
spin, +1 or -1), and has zero rest mass. In this respect it is very much
like a photon. However, it has a much greater momentum, thus explaining
its destructive effect on computer electronics and human nervous
systems. The corollary to this is that bogons also have tremendous
inertia, and therefore a bogon beam is deflected only with great
difficulty. When the bogon encounters its antiparticle, the cluon, they
mutually annihilate each other, releasing magic smoke. Furthermore 1
Lenat = 1 mole (6.022E23) of bogons (see
`*microLenat* <../M/microLenat.html>`__).

**quine**: /kwi:n/, n.

[from the name of the logician Willard van Orman Quine, via Douglas
Hofstadter] A program that generates a copy of its own source text as
its complete output. Devising the shortest possible quine in some given
programming language is a common hackish amusement. (We ignore some
variants of BASIC in which a program consisting of a single empty string
literal reproduces itself trivially.) Here is one classic quine:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .. code:: programlisting                                                 |
|                                                                          |
|     ((lambda (x)                                                         |
|       (list x (list (quote quote) x)))                                   |
|      (quote                                                              |
|         (lambda (x)                                                      |
|           (list x (list (quote quote) x)))))                             |
                                                                          
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This one works in LISP or Scheme. It's relatively easy to write quines
in other languages such as Postscript which readily handle programs as
data; much harder (and thus more challenging!) in languages like C which
do not. Here is a classic C quine for ASCII machines:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .. code:: programlisting                                                 |
|                                                                          |
|     char*f="char*f=%c%s%c;main()                                         |
|     {printf(f,34,f,34,10);}%c";                                          |
|     main(){printf(f,34,f,34,10);}                                        |
                                                                          
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

For excruciatingly exact quinishness, remove the interior line breaks.
Here is another elegant quine in ANSI C:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .. code:: programlisting                                                 |
|                                                                          |
|     #define q(k)main(){return!puts(#k"\nq("#k")");}                      |
|     q(#define q(k)main(){return!puts(#k"\nq("#k")");})                   |

**quux**: /kwuhks/, n.

[Mythically, from the Latin semi-deponent verb quuxo, quuxare, quuxandum
iri; noun form variously ‘quux’ (plural ‘quuces’, anglicized to
‘quuxes’) and ‘quuxu’ (genitive plural is ‘quuxuum’, for four u-letters
out of seven in all, using up all the ‘u’ letters in Scrabble).]

1. Originally, a `*metasyntactic
variable* <../M/metasyntactic-variable.html>`__ like
`*foo* <../F/foo.html>`__ and `*foobar* <../F/foobar.html>`__. Invented
by Guy Steele for precisely this purpose when he was young and naive and
not yet interacting with the real computing community. Many people
invent such words; this one seems simply to have been lucky enough to
have spread a little. In an eloquent display of poetic justice, it has
returned to the originator in the form of a nickname.

2. interj. See `*foo* <../F/foo.html>`__; however, denotes very little
disgust, and is uttered mostly for the sake of the sound of it.

3. Guy Steele in his persona as ‘The Great Quux’, which is somewhat
infamous for light verse and for the ‘Crunchly’ cartoons.

4. In some circles, used as a punning opposite of ‘crux’. “Ah, that's
the quux of the matter!” implies that the point is *not* crucial
(compare `*tip of the ice-cube* <../T/tip-of-the-ice-cube.html>`__).

**QWERTY**: /kwer´tee/, adj.

[from the keycaps at the upper left] Pertaining to a standard
English-language typewriter keyboard (sometimes called the Sholes
keyboard after its inventor), as opposed to Dvorak or non-US-ASCII
layouts or a `*space-cadet keyboard* <../S/space-cadet-keyboard.html>`__
or APL keyboard.

Historical note: The QWERTY layout is a fine example of a
`*fossil* <../F/fossil.html>`__. It is sometimes said that it was
designed to slow down the typist, but this is wrong; it was designed to
allow *faster* typing — under a constraint now long obsolete. In early
typewriters, fast typing using nearby type-bars jammed the mechanism. So
Sholes fiddled the layout to separate the letters of many common
digraphs (he did a far from perfect job, though; ‘th’, ‘tr’, ‘ed’, and
‘er’, for example, each use two nearby keys). Also, putting the letters
of ‘typewriter’ on one line allowed it to be typed with particular speed
and accuracy for `*demo* <../D/demo.html>`__\ s. The jamming problem was
essentially solved soon afterward by a suitable use of springs, but the
keyboard layout lives on.

The QWERTY keyboard has also spawned some unhelpful economic myths about
how technical standards get and stay established; see
