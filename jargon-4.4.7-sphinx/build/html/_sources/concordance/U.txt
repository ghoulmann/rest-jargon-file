Unix brain damage

--------------

**Unix brain damage**: n.

Something that has to be done to break a network program (typically a
mailer) on a non-Unix system so that it will interoperate with Unix
systems. The hack may qualify as Unix brain damage if the program
conforms to published standards and the Unix program in question does
not. Unix brain damage happens because it is much easier for other
(minority) systems to change their ways to match non-conforming behavior
than it is to change all the hundreds of thousands of Unix systems out
there.

An example of Unix brain damage is a `*kluge* <../K/kluge.html>`__ in a
mail server to recognize bare line feed (the Unix newline) as an
equivalent form to the Internet standard newline, which is a carriage
return followed by a line feed. Such things can make even a hardened
`*jock* <../J/jock.html>`__ weep.

Unix conspiracy

--------------

**Unix conspiracy**: n.

[ITS] According to a conspiracy theory long popular among
`*ITS* <../I/ITS.html>`__ and `*TOPS-20* <../T/TOPS-20.html>`__ fans,
Unix's growth is the result of a plot, hatched during the 1970s at Bell
Labs, whose intent was to hobble AT&T's competitors by making them
dependent upon a system whose future evolution was to be under AT&T's
control. This would be accomplished by disseminating an operating system
that is apparently inexpensive and easily portable, but also relatively
unreliable and insecure (so as to require continuing upgrades from
AT&T). This theory was lent a substantial impetus in 1984 by the paper
referenced in the `*back door* <../B/back-door.html>`__ entry.

In this view, Unix was designed to be one of the first computer viruses
(see `*virus* <../V/virus.html>`__) — but a virus spread to computers
indirectly by people and market forces, rather than directly through
disks and networks. Adherents of this ‘Unix virus’ theory like to cite
the fact that the well-known quotation “Unix is snake oil” was uttered
by `*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__ president Kenneth Olsen shortly before DEC
began actively promoting its own family of Unix workstations. (Olsen now
claims to have been misquoted.)

If there was ever such a conspiracy, it got thoroughly out of the
plotters' control after 1990. AT&T sold its Unix operation to Novell
around the same time `*Linux* <../L/Linux.html>`__ and other free-Unix
distributions were beginning to make noise.

**Unix**: /yoo´niks/, n.

[In the authors' words, “A weak pun on Multics”; very early on it was
“UNICS”] (also “UNIX”) An interactive timesharing system invented in
1969 by Ken Thompson after Bell Labs left the Multics project,
originally so he could play games on his scavenged PDP-7. Dennis
Ritchie, the inventor of C, is considered a co-author of the system. The
turning point in Unix's history came when it was reimplemented almost
entirely in C during 1972—1974, making it the first source-portable OS.
Unix subsequently underwent mutations and expansions at the hands of
many different people, resulting in a uniquely flexible and
developer-friendly environment. By 1991, Unix had become the most widely
used multiuser general-purpose operating system in the world — and since
1996 the variant called `*Linux* <../L/Linux.html>`__ has been at the
cutting edge of the `*open source* <../O/open-source.html>`__ movement.
Many people consider the success of Unix the most important victory yet
of hackerdom over industry opposition (but see `*Unix
weenie* <Unix-weenie.html>`__ and `*Unix
conspiracy* <Unix-conspiracy.html>`__ for an opposing point of view).
See `*Version 7* <../V/Version-7.html>`__, `*BSD* <../B/BSD.html>`__,
`*Linux* <../L/Linux.html>`__.

|image0|

Archetypal hackers ken (left) and dmr (right).

Some people are confused over whether this word is appropriately ‘UNIX’
or ‘Unix’; both forms are common, and used interchangeably. Dennis
Ritchie says that the ‘UNIX’ spelling originally happened in CACM's 1974
paper *The UNIX Time-Sharing System* because “we had a new typesetter
and `*troff* <../T/troff.html>`__ had just been invented and we were
intoxicated by being able to produce small caps.” Later, dmr tried to
get the spelling changed to ‘Unix’ in a couple of Bell Labs papers, on
the grounds that the word is not acronymic. He failed, and eventually
(his words) “wimped out” on the issue. So, while the trademark today is
‘UNIX’, both capitalizations are grounded in ancient usage; the Jargon
File uses ‘Unix’ in deference to dmr's wishes.

[ITS]

1. A derogatory play on ‘Unix wizard’, common among hackers who use Unix
by necessity but would prefer alternatives. The implication is that
although the person in question may consider mastery of Unix arcana to
be a wizardly skill, the only real skill involved is the ability to
tolerate (and the bad taste to wallow in) the incoherence and needless
complexity that is alleged to infest many Unix programs. “This shell
script tries to parse its arguments in 69 bletcherous ways. It must have
been written by a real Unix weenie.”

**Usenet Death Penalty**

[Usenet] A sanction against sites that habitually spew Usenet
`*spam* <../S/spam.html>`__. This can be either passive or active. A
passive UDP refers to the dropping of all postings by a particular
domain so as to inhibit propagation. An active UDP refers to third-party
cancellation of all postings by the UDPed domain. A partial UDP is one
which applies only to certain newsgroups or hierarchies in Usenet.
Compare `*Internet Death Penalty* <../I/Internet-Death-Penalty.html>`__,
with which this term is sometimes confused.

Usenet

**Usenet**: /yoos´net/, /yooz´net/, n.

[from ‘Users' Network’; the original spelling was USENET, but the
mixed-case form is now widely preferred] A distributed
`*bboard* <../B/bboard.html>`__ (bulletin board) system supported mainly
by Unix machines. Originally implemented in 1979--1980 by Steve
Bellovin, Jim Ellis, Tom Truscott, and Steve Daniel at Duke University
and the University of North Carolina, it has swiftly grown to become
international in scope and is now probably the largest decentralized
information utility in existence. As of late 2002, it hosts over 100,000
`*newsgroup* <../N/newsgroup.html>`__\ s and an unguessably huge volume
of new technical articles, news, discussion, chatter, and
`*flamage* <../F/flamage.html>`__ every day (and that leaves out the
graphics...).

By the year the Internet hit the mainstream (1994) the original UUCP
transport for Usenet was fading out of use — almost all Usenet
connections were over Internet links. A lot of newbies and journalists
began to refer to “Internet newsgroups” as though Usenet was and always
had been just another Internet service. This ignorance greatly annoys
experienced Usenetters.

describe systems that hold the user's hand so obsessively that they make
it painful for the more experienced and knowledgeable to get any work
done. See `*menuitis* <../M/menuitis.html>`__, `*drool-proof

**user**: n.

1. Someone doing ‘real work’ with the computer, using it as a means
rather than an end. Someone who pays to use a computer. See `*real
user* <../R/real-user.html>`__.

2. A programmer who will believe anything you tell him. One who asks
silly questions. [GLS observes: This is slightly unfair. It is true that
users ask questions (of necessity). Sometimes they are thoughtful or
deep. Very often they are annoying or downright stupid, apparently
because the user failed to think for two seconds or look in the
documentation before bothering the maintainer.] See
`*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__.

3. Someone who uses a program from the outside, however skillfully,
without getting into the internals of the program. One who reports bugs
instead of just going ahead and fixing them.

The general theory behind this term is that there are two classes of
people who work with a program: there are implementors (hackers) and
`*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__\ s. The users are looked down on by
hackers to some extent because they don't understand the full
ramifications of the system in all its glory. (The few users who do are
known as real winners.) The term is a relative one: a skilled hacker may
be a user with respect to some program he himself does not hack. A LISP
hacker might be one who maintains LISP or one who uses LISP (but with
the skill of a hacker). A LISP user is one who uses LISP, whether
skillfully or not. Thus there is some overlap between the two terms; the
subtle distinctions must be resolved by context.

Anywhere outside the kernel. “That code belongs in userland.” This term
has been in common use among Unix kernel hackers since at least 1985,
and may have have originated in that community. The earliest sighting
was reported from the usenet group net.unix-wizards.

**Utah teapot, the**

This object is historically one of the first complex 3D models to be
rendered in computer graphics. It consisted of about 110 vertices, and
was generated by Martin Newell in 1974 using hand-drawn Bezier curves,
based on a real teapot that he and his wife had bought. This model
served as a basis for comparing various 3D rendering methodologies for
lighting, textures, bump-mapping, etc. By the standards of 2002, the
model is trivial to render and thus is often not suited to demonstrate
the complexity of modern research. Despite this, the tea pot still
appears, now and then, in recent papers. More on the teapot's history
lives at `The History Of The Teapot <http://www.sjbaker.org/teapot/>`__.

**UTSL**: //, n.

[Unix] On-line acronym for ‘Use the Source, Luke’ (a pun on Obi-Wan
Kenobi's “Use the Force, Luke!” in *Star Wars*) — analogous to
`*RTFS* <../R/RTFS.html>`__ (sense 1), but more polite. This is a common
way of suggesting that someone would be better off reading the source
code that supports whatever feature is causing confusion, rather than
making yet another futile pass through the manuals, or broadcasting
questions on Usenet that haven't attracted
`*wizard* <../W/wizard.html>`__\ s to answer them.

Once upon a time in `*elder days* <../E/elder-days.html>`__, everyone
running Unix had source. After 1978, AT&T's policy tightened up, so this
objurgation was in theory appropriately directed only at associates of
some outfit with a Unix source license. In practice, bootlegs of Unix
source code (made precisely for reference purposes) were so ubiquitous
that one could utter it at almost anyone on the network without concern.

Nowadays, free Unix clones have become widely enough distributed that
anyone can read source legally. The most widely distributed is certainly
Linux, with variants of the NET/2 and 4.4BSD distributions running
second. Cheap commercial Unixes with source such as BSD/OS are
accelerating this trend.

UUOC

--------------

**UUOC**

[from the comp.unix.shell group on Usenet] Stands for Useless Use of
`*cat* <../C/cat.html>`__; the reference is to the Unix command cat(1),
not the feline animal. As received wisdom on comp.unix.shell observes,
“The purpose of cat is to concatenate (or ‘catenate’) files. If it's
only one file, concatenating it with nothing at all is a waste of time,
and costs you a process.” Nevertheless one sees people doing

| 
|  cat file \| some\_command and its args ...

instead of the equivalent and cheaper

| 
|  <file some\_command and its args ...

or (equivalently and more classically)

| 
|  some\_command and its args ... <file

Since 1995, occasional awards for UUOC have been given out, usually by
Perl luminary Randal L. Schwartz. There is a `web
page <http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~reriksso/unix/award.html>`__ devoted
to this and other similar awards.
