**daemon book**: n.

*The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating System*, by
Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels, and John
S. Quarterman (Addison-Wesley Publishers, 1989, ISBN 0-201-06196-1); or
*The Design and Implementation of the 4.4 BSD Operating System* by
Marshall Kirk McKusick, Keith Bostic, Michael J. Karels and John S.
Quarterman (Addison-Wesley Longman, 1996, ISBN 0-201-54979-4) Either of
the standard reference books on the internals of
`*BSD* <../B/BSD.html>`__ Unix. So called because the covers have a
picture depicting a little demon (a visual play on
`*daemon* <daemon.html>`__) in sneakers, holding a pitchfork (referring
to one of the characteristic features of Unix, the fork(2) system call).

daemon

 `Next <daemon-book.html>`__

--------------

**daemon**: /day´mn/, /dee´mn/, n.

[from Maxwell's Demon, later incorrectly retronymed as ‘Disk And
Execution MONitor’] A program that is not invoked explicitly, but lies
dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur. The idea is that the
perpetrator of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is lurking
(though often a program will commit an action only because it knows that
it will implicitly invoke a daemon). For example, under
`*ITS* <../I/ITS.html>`__, writing a file on the LPT spooler's directory
would invoke the spooling daemon, which would then print the file. The
advantage is that programs wanting (in this example) files printed need
neither compete for access to nor understand any idiosyncrasies of the
LPT. They simply enter their implicit requests and let the daemon decide
what to do with them. Daemons are usually spawned automatically by the
system, and may either live forever or be regenerated at intervals.

Daemon and `*demon* <demon.html>`__ are often used interchangeably, but
seem to have distinct connotations. The term daemon was introduced to
computing by `*CTSS* <../C/CTSS.html>`__ people (who pronounced it
/dee´mon/) and used it to refer to what ITS called a
`*dragon* <dragon.html>`__; the prototype was a program called DAEMON
that automatically made tape backups of the file system. Although the
meaning and the pronunciation have drifted, we think this glossary
reflects current (2003) usage.

**dangling pointer**: n.

[common] A reference that doesn't actually lead anywhere (in C and some
other languages, a pointer that doesn't actually point at anything
valid). Usually this happens because it formerly pointed to something
that has moved or disappeared. Used as jargon in a generalization of its
techspeak meaning; for example, a local phone number for a person who
has since moved to the other coast is a dangling pointer.

Following a change of editorship in 1994, Datamation briefly tried for
more the technical content and irreverent humor that marked its early
days, but this did not last.

[Unix: from IBM `*JCL* <../J/JCL.html>`__] Equivalent to

name of a Unix copy command with special options suitable for
block-oriented devices; it was often used in heavy-handed system
maintenance, as in “Let's **dd** the root partition onto a tape, then
use the boot PROM to load it back on to a new disk”. The Unix dd(1) was
designed with a weird, distinctly non-Unixy keyword option syntax
reminiscent of IBM System/360 JCL (which had an elaborate DD ‘Dataset
Definition’ specification for I/O devices); though the command filled a
need, the interface design was clearly a prank. The jargon usage is now
very rare outside Unix sites and now nearly obsolete even there, as
dd(1) has been `*deprecated* <deprecated.html>`__ for a long time
(though it has no exact replacement). The term has been displaced by
`*BLT* <../B/BLT.html>`__ or simple English ‘copy’.

DDT

`Prev <dd.html>`__ 

D

 `Next <de-rezz.html>`__

--------------

**DDT**: /D·D·T/, n.

[from the insecticide para-dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethene]

1. Generic term for a program that assists in debugging other programs
by showing individual machine instructions in a readable symbolic form
and letting the user change them. In this sense the term DDT is now
archaic, having been widely displaced by debugger or names of individual
programs like **adb**, **sdb**, **dbx**, or **gdb**.

2. [ITS] Under MIT's fabled `*ITS* <../I/ITS.html>`__ operating system,
DDT (running under the alias HACTRN, a six-letterism for ‘Hack
Translator’) was also used as the `*shell* <../S/shell.html>`__ or top
level command language used to execute other programs.

3. Any one of several specific DDTs (sense 1) supported on early
`*DEC* <DEC.html>`__ hardware and CP/M. The PDP-10 Reference Handbook
(1969) contained a footnote on the first page of the documentation for
DDT that illuminates the origin of the term:

    Historical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1 computer
    in 1961. At that time DDT stood for “DEC Debugging Tape”. Since
    then, the idea of an on-line debugging program has propagated
    throughout the computer industry. DDT programs are now available for
    all DEC computers. Since media other than tape are now frequently
    used, the more descriptive name “Dynamic Debugging Technique” has
    been adopted, retaining the DDT abbreviation. Confusion between
    DDT-10 and another well known pesticide,
    dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane
    C\ :sub:`14`\ H\ :sub:`9`\ Cl\ :sub:`5` should be minimal since each
    attacks a different, and apparently mutually exclusive, class of
    bugs.

(The ‘tape’ referred to was, incidentally, not magnetic but paper.)
Sadly, this quotation was removed from later editions of the handbook
after the `*suit* <../S/suit.html>`__\ s took over and
`*DEC* <DEC.html>`__ became much more ‘businesslike’.

The history above is known to many old-time hackers. But there's more:
Peter Samson, compiler of the original `*TMRC* <../T/TMRC.html>`__
lexicon, reports that he named DDT after a similar tool on the TX-0
computer, the direct ancestor of the PDP-1 built at MIT's Lincoln Lab in
1957. The debugger on that ground-breaking machine (the first
transistorized computer) rejoiced in the name FLIT (FLexowriter
Interrogation Tape). Flit was for many years the trade-name of a popular
insecticide.

**dead beef attack**: n.

[cypherpunks list, 1996] An attack on a public-key cryptosystem
consisting of publishing a key having the same ID as another key (thus
making it possible to spoof a user's identity if recipients aren't
careful about verifying keys). In PGP and GPG the key ID is the last
eight hex digits of (for RSA keys) the product of two primes. The attack
was demonstrated by creating a key whose ID was 0xdeadbeef (see
`*DEADBEEF* <DEADBEEF.html>`__).

The hexadecimal word-fill pattern for freshly allocated memory under a

alterations in the program or significant changes in the assumptions and
environment of the program (see also `*software

deadlock

--------------

**deadlock**: n.

1. [techspeak] A situation wherein two or more processes are unable to
proceed because each is waiting for one of the others to do something. A
common example is a program communicating to a server, which may find
itself waiting for output from the server before sending anything more
to it, while the server is similarly waiting for more input from the
controlling program before outputting anything. (It is reported that
this particular flavor of deadlock is sometimes called a starvation
deadlock, though the term starvation is more properly used for
situations where a program can never run simply because it never gets
high enough priority. Another common flavor is constipation, in which
each process is trying to send stuff to the other but all buffers are
full because nobody is reading anything.) See `*deadly
embrace* <deadly-embrace.html>`__.

2. Also used of deadlock-like interactions between humans, as when two
people meet in a narrow corridor, and each tries to be polite by moving
aside to let the other pass, but they end up swaying from side to side
without making any progress because they always move the same way at the
same time.

**death code**: n.

A routine whose job is to set everything in the computer — registers,
memory, flags, everything — to zero, including that portion of memory
where it is running; its last act is to `*stomp
on* <../S/stomp-on.html>`__ its own “store zero” instruction. Death code
isn't very useful, but writing it is an interesting hacking challenge on
architectures where the instruction set makes it possible, such as the
PDP-8 (it has also been done on the DG Nova).

Perhaps the ultimate death code is on the TI 990 series, where all
registers are actually in RAM, and the instruction “store immediate 0”
has the opcode “0”. The PC will immediately wrap around core as many
times as it can until a user hits HALT. Any empty memory location is
death code. Worse, the manufacturer recommended use of this instruction
in startup code (which would be in ROM and therefore survive).

1. The AT&T corporate logo, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the

among partisans of `*BSD* <../B/BSD.html>`__ Unix in the 1980s, who
tended to regard the AT&T versions as inferior and AT&T as a bad guy.
Copies still circulate of a poster printed by Mt. Xinu showing a
starscape with a space fighter labeled 4.2 BSD streaking away from a
broken AT&T logo wreathed in flames.

2. AT&T's internal magazine, *Focus*, uses death star to describe an
incorrectly done AT&T logo in which the inner circle in the top left is
dark instead of light — a frequent result of dark-on-light logo images.

**Death, X of**

[common] A construction used to imbue the subject with campy menace,
usually with intent to ridicule. The ancestor of this term is a famous
*Far Side* cartoon from the 1980s in which a balloon with a fierce face
painted on it is passed off as the “Floating Head of Death”. Hackers and
SF fans have been using the suffix “of Death” ever since to label things
which appear to be vastly threatening but will actually pop like a
balloon if you prick them. Such constructions are properly spoken in a
tone of over-exagerrated portentiousness: “Behold! The Spinning - Pizza
- of - *Death*!” See `*Blue Screen of
Death* <../B/Blue-Screen-of-Death.html>`__, `*Ping O'
Death* <../P/Ping-O--Death.html>`__, `*Spinning Pizza of

**DEC**: /dek/, n.

n. Commonly used abbreviation for Digital Equipment Corporation, later
deprecated by DEC itself in favor of “Digital” and now entirely obsolete
following the buyout by Compaq. Before the `*killer
micro* <../K/killer-micro.html>`__ revolution of the late 1980s,
hackerdom was closely symbiotic with DEC's pioneering timesharing
machines. The first of the group of cultures described by this lexicon
nucleated around the PDP-1 (see `*TMRC* <../T/TMRC.html>`__).
Subsequently, the PDP-6, `*PDP-10* <../P/PDP-10.html>`__,
`*PDP-20* <../P/PDP-20.html>`__, `*PDP-11* <../P/PDP-11.html>`__ and
`*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__ were all foci of large and important
hackerdoms, and DEC machines long dominated the ARPANET and Internet
machine population. DEC was the technological leader of the minicomputer
era (roughly 1967 to 1987), but its failure to embrace microcomputers
and Unix early cost it heavily in profits and prestige after
`*silicon* <../S/silicon.html>`__ got cheap. Nevertheless, the
microprocessor design tradition owes a major debt to the
`*PDP-11* <../P/PDP-11.html>`__ instruction set, and every one of the
major general-purpose microcomputer OSs so far (CP/M, MS-DOS, Unix,
OS/2, Windows NT) was either genetically descended from a DEC OS, or
incubated on DEC hardware, or both. Accordingly, DEC was for many years
still regarded with a certain wry affection even among many hackers too
young to have grown up on DEC machines.

2. The act of completely removing Micro$oft Windows from a PC in favor
of a better OS (typically Linux).

5. [obs.] The act of exiting a window system in order to get better
response time from a full-screen program. This comes from the dictionary
meaning of defenestrate, which is to throw something out a window.

[portmanteau of “defective” and “afflicted”; common among PC repair
technicians, and probably originated among hardware techs outside the
hacker community proper] Term used of hardware that is broken due to
poor design or shoddy manufacturing or (especially) both; less
frequently used of software and rarely of people. This term is normally
employed in a tone of weary contempt by technicians who have seen the
specific failure in the trouble report before and are cynically
confident they'll see it again. Ultimately this may derive from Frank
Zappa's 1974 album *Apostrophe*, on which the Fur Trapper infamously
rubs his deflicted eyes...

**delta**: n.

1. [techspeak] A quantitative change, especially a small or incremental
one (this use is general in physics and engineering). “I just doubled
the speed of my program!” “What was the delta on program size?” “About
30 percent.” (He doubled the speed of his program, but increased its
size by only 30 percent.)

2. [Unix] A `*diff* <diff.html>`__, especially a `*diff* <diff.html>`__
stored under the set of version-control tools called SCCS (Source Code
Control System) or RCS (Revision Control System).

3. n. A small quantity, but not as small as
`*epsilon* <../E/epsilon.html>`__. The jargon usage of
`*delta* <delta.html>`__ and `*epsilon* <../E/epsilon.html>`__ stems
from the traditional use of these letters in mathematics for very small
numerical quantities, particularly in ‘epsilon-delta’ proofs in limit
theory (as in the differential calculus). The term
`*delta* <delta.html>`__ is often used, once
`*epsilon* <../E/epsilon.html>`__ has been mentioned, to mean a quantity
that is slightly bigger than `*epsilon* <../E/epsilon.html>`__ but still
very small. “The cost isn't epsilon, but it's delta” means that the cost
isn't totally negligible, but it is nevertheless very small. Common
constructions include within delta of —, within epsilon of —: that is,
‘close to’ and ‘even closer to’.

**demigod**: n.

A hacker with years of experience, a world-wide reputation, and a major
role in the development of at least one design, tool, or game used by or
known to more than half of the hacker community. To qualify as a genuine
demigod, the person must recognizably identify with the hacker community
and have helped shape it. Major demigods include Ken Thompson and Dennis
Ritchie (co-inventors of `*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__ and
`*C* <../C/C.html>`__), Richard M. Stallman (inventor of
`*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__), Larry Wall (inventor of

`*GOSMACS* <../G/GOSMACS.html>`__) and Guido van Rossum (inventor of
`*Python* <../P/Python.html>`__). In their hearts of hearts, most
hackers dream of someday becoming demigods themselves, and more than one
major software project has been driven to completion by the author's
veiled hopes of apotheosis. See also `*net.god* <../N/net-god.html>`__,

--------------

**demon**: n.

1. Often used equivalently to `*daemon* <daemon.html>`__ — especially in
the `*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__ world, where the latter spelling and
pronunciation is considered mildly archaic.

2. [MIT; now probably obsolete] A portion of a program that is not
invoked explicitly, but that lies dormant waiting for some condition(s)
to occur. See `*daemon* <daemon.html>`__. The distinction is that demons
are usually processes within a program, while daemons are usually
programs running on an operating system.

Demons in sense 2 are particularly common in AI programs. For example, a
knowledge-manipulation program might implement inference rules as
demons. Whenever a new piece of knowledge was added, various demons
would activate (which demons depends on the particular piece of data)
and would create additional pieces of knowledge by applying their
respective inference rules to the original piece. These new pieces could
in turn activate more demons as the inferences filtered down through
chains of logic. Meanwhile, the main program could continue with
whatever its primary task was.

demoparties, for 100 persons or less, are held quite often, sometimes
even once a month, and usually last for one to two days. On the other
end of the scale, huge demo parties are held once a year (and four of
these have grown very large and occur annually — Assembly in Finland,
The Party in Denmark, The Gathering in Norway, and NAID somewhere in
north America). These parties usually last for three to five days, have
room for 3000-5000 people, and have a party network with connection to
the internet.

demoscene

--------------

**demoscene**: /dem´oh·seen/

[also ‘demo scene’] A culture of multimedia hackers located primarily in
Scandinavia and northern Europe. Demoscene folklore recounts that when
old-time `*warez d00dz* <../W/warez-d00dz.html>`__ cracked some piece of
software they often added an advertisement in the beginning, usually
containing colorful `*display hack* <display-hack.html>`__\ s with
greetings to other cracking groups. The demoscene was born among people
who decided building these display hacks is more interesting than
hacking — or anyway safer. Around 1990 there began to be very serious
police pressure on cracking groups, including raids with SWAT teams
crashing into bedrooms to confiscate computers. Whether in response to
this or for esthetic reasons, crackers of that period began to build
self-contained display hacks of considerable elaboration and beauty
(within the culture such a hack is called a `*demo* <demo.html>`__). As
more of these `*demogroup* <demogroup.html>`__\ s emerged, they started
to have `*compo* <../C/compo.html>`__\ s at copying parties (see
`*copyparty* <../C/copyparty.html>`__), which later evolved to
standalone events (see `*demoparty* <demoparty.html>`__). The demoscene
has retained some traits from the `*warez
d00dz* <../W/warez-d00dz.html>`__, including their style of handles and
group names and some of their jargon.

Traditionally demos were written in assembly language, with lots of
smart tricks, self-modifying code, undocumented op-codes and the like.
Some time around 1995, people started coding demos in C, and a couple of
years after that, they also started using Java.

Ten years on (in 1998-1999), the demoscene is changing as its original
platforms (C64, Amiga, Spectrum, Atari ST, IBM PC under DOS) die out and
activity shifts towards Windows, Linux, and the Internet. While deeply
underground in the past, demoscene is trying to get into the mainstream
as accepted art form, and one symptom of this is the commercialization
of bigger demoparties. Older demosceners frown at this, but the majority
think it's a good direction. Many demosceners end up working in the
computer game industry. Demoscene resource pages are available at
`http://www.oldskool.org/demos/explained/ <http://www.oldskool.org/demos/explained/>`__
and `http://www.scene.org/ <http://www.scene.org/>`__.

**deprecated**: adj.

Said of a program or feature that is considered obsolescent and in the
process of being phased out, usually in favor of a specified
replacement. Deprecated features can, unfortunately, linger on for many
years. This term appears with distressing frequency in standards
documents when the committees writing the documents realize that large
amounts of extant (and presumably happily working) code depend on the
feature(s) that have passed out of favor. See also `*dusty
deck* <dusty-deck.html>`__.

[Usage note: don't confuse this word with ‘depreciated’, or the verb
form ‘deprecate’ with ‘depreciate’. They are different words; see any
dictionary for discussion.]

**de-rezz**: /dee·rez´/

[from ‘de-resolve’ via the movie *Tron*] (also derez)

1. vi. To disappear or dissolve; the image that goes with it is of an
object breaking up into raster lines and static and then dissolving.
Occasionally used of a person who seems to have suddenly ‘fuzzed out’
mentally rather than physically. Usage: extremely silly, also rare. This
verb was actually invented as *fictional* hacker jargon, and adopted in
a spirit of irony by real hackers years after the fact.

2. vt. The Macintosh resource decompiler. On a Macintosh, many program
structures (including the code itself) are managed in small segments of
the program file known as resources; Rez and DeRez are a pair of
utilities for compiling and decompiling resource files. Thus,
decompiling a resource is derezzing. Usage: very common.

**dike**: vt.

To remove or disable a portion of something, as a wire from a computer
or a subroutine from a program. A standard slogan is “When in doubt,
dike it out”. (The implication is that it is usually more effective to
attack software problems by reducing complexity than by increasing it.)
The word ‘dikes’ is widely used to mean ‘diagonal cutters’, a kind of
wire cutter. To ‘dike something out’ means to use such cutters to remove
something. Indeed, the TMRC Dictionary defined dike as “to attack with
dikes”. Among hackers this term has been metaphorically extended to
informational objects such as sections of code.

**Dilbert**

n. Name and title character of a comic strip nationally syndicated in
the U.S. and enormously popular among hackers. Dilbert is an
archetypical engineer-nerd who works at an anonymous high-technology
company; the strips present a lacerating satire of insane working
conditions and idiotic `*management* <../M/management.html>`__ practices
all too readily recognized by hackers. Adams, who spent nine years in
`*cube* <../C/cube.html>`__ 4S700R at Pacific Bell (not
`*DEC* <DEC.html>`__ as often reported), often remarks that he has never
been able to come up with a fictional management blunder that his
correspondents didn't quickly either report to have actually happened or
top with a similar but even more bizarre incident. In 1996 Adams
distilled his insights into the collective psychology of businesses into
an even funnier book, *The Dilbert Principle* (HarperCollins, ISBN
0-887-30787-6). See also `*pointy-haired* <../P/pointy-haired.html>`__,

hacker working on a CP/M system with 64K, in reference to any 6502
system, then from fans of 32-bit architectures about 16-bit machines.
“GNUMACS will never work on that dink machine.” Probably derived from

especially of old minis and mainframes, in contrast with newer
microprocessor-based machines. In a famous quote from the 1998 Unix
EXPO, Bill Joy compared the liquid-cooled mainframe in the massive IBM
display with a grazing dinosaur “with a truck outside pumping its bodily
fluids through it”. IBM was not amused. Compare `*big

--------------

**dinosaurs mating**: n.

Said to occur when yet another `*big iron* <../B/big-iron.html>`__
merger or buyout occurs; originally reflected a perception by hackers
that these signal another stage in the long, slow dying of the
`*mainframe* <../M/mainframe.html>`__ industry. In the mainframe
industry's glory days of the 1960s, it was ‘IBM and the Seven Dwarfs’:
Burroughs, Control Data, General Electric, Honeywell, NCR, RCA, and
Univac. RCA and GE sold out early, and it was ‘IBM and the Bunch’
(Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell) for a while.
Honeywell was bought out by Bull; Burroughs merged with Univac to form
Unisys (in 1984 — this was when the phrase dinosaurs mating was coined);
and in 1991 AT&T absorbed NCR (but spat it back out a few years later).
Control Data still exists but is no longer in the mainframe business. In
similar wave of dinosaur-matings as the PC business began to consolidate
after 1995, Digital Equipment was bought by Compaq which was bought by
Hewlett-Packard. More such earth-shaking unions of doomed giants seem
inevitable.

**Discordianism**: /dis·kor´di·@n·ism/, n.

The veneration of `*Eris* <../E/Eris.html>`__, a.k.a. Discordia; widely
popular among hackers. Discordianism was popularized by Robert Shea and
Robert Anton Wilson's novel *Illuminatus!* as a sort of self-subverting
Dada-Zen for Westerners — it should on no account be taken seriously but
is far more serious than most jokes. Consider, for example, the Fifth
Commandment of the Pentabarf, from *Principia Discordia*: “A Discordian
is Prohibited of Believing What he Reads.” Discordianism is usually
connected with an elaborate conspiracy theory/joke involving
millennia-long warfare between the anarcho-surrealist partisans of Eris
and a malevolent, authoritarian secret society called the Illuminati.

--------------

**Dissociated Press**: n.

[play on ‘Associated Press’; perhaps inspired by a reference in the 1950
Bugs Bunny cartoon *What's Up, Doc?*] An algorithm for transforming any
text into potentially humorous garbage even more efficiently than by
passing it through a `*marketroid* <../M/marketroid.html>`__. The
algorithm starts by printing any ``N`` consecutive words (or letters) in
the text. Then at every step it searches for any random occurrence in
the original text of the last ``N`` words (or letters) already printed
and then prints the next word or letter. `*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__
has a handy command for this. Here is a short example of word-based
Dissociated Press applied to an earlier version of this Jargon File:

    wart: n. A small, crocky `*feature* <../F/feature.html>`__ that
    sticks out of an array (C has no checks for this). This is
    relatively benign and easy to spot if the phrase is bent so as to be
    not worth paying attention to the medium in question.

Here is a short example of letter-based Dissociated Press applied to the
same source:

    window sysIWYG: n. A bit was named aften /bee´t@/ prefer to use the
    other guy's re, especially in every cast a chuckle on neithout
    getting into useful informash speech makes removing a featuring a
    move or usage actual abstractionsidered interj. Indeed spectace
    logic or problem!

A hackish idle pastime is to apply letter-based Dissociated Press to a
random body of text and `*vgrep* <../V/vgrep.html>`__ the output in
hopes of finding an interesting new word. (In the preceding example,
‘window sysIWYG’ and ‘informash’ show some promise.) Iterated
applications of Dissociated Press usually yield better results. Similar
techniques called travesty generators have been employed with
considerable satirical effect to the utterances of Usenet flamers; see
`*pseudo* <../P/pseudo.html>`__.

environment (the phrase is used outside Microsoft and Netscape). The
practice is normal in the Linux community and elsewhere, but the term
‘dogfood’ is seldom used as open-source betas tend to be quite tasty and
nourishing. The idea is that developers who are using their own software
will quickly learn what's missing or broken. Dogfood is typically not

**dogpile**: v.

[Usenet: prob. fr. mainstream “puppy pile”] When many people post
unfriendly responses in short order to a single posting, they are
sometimes said to “dogpile” or “dogpile on” the person to whom they're
responding. For example, when a religious missionary posts a simplistic
appeal to ``alt.atheism``, he can expect to be dogpiled. It has been
suggested that this derives from U.S. football slang for a tackle
involving three or more people; among hackers, it seems at least as
likely to derive from an ‘autobiographical’ Bugs Bunny cartoon in which
a gang of attacking canines actually yells “Dogpile on the rabbit!”.

**dongle**: /dong´gl/, n.

1. [now obs.] A security or `*copy
protection* <../C/copy-protection.html>`__ device for proprietary
software consisting of a serialized EPROM and some drivers in a D-25
connector shell, which must be connected to an I/O port of the computer
while the program is run. Programs that use a dongle query the port at
startup and at programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate if it does
not respond with the dongle's programmed validation code. Thus, users
can make as many copies of the program as they want but must pay for
each dongle. The first sighting of a dongle was in 1984, associated with
a software product called PaperClip. The idea was clever, but it was
initially a failure, as users disliked tying up a serial port this way.
By 1993, dongles would typically pass data through the port and monitor
for `*magic* <../M/magic.html>`__ codes (and combinations of status
lines) with minimal if any interference with devices further down the
line — this innovation was necessary to allow daisy-chained dongles for
multiple pieces of software. These devices have become rare as the
industry has moved away from copy-protection schemes in general.

2. By extension, any physical electronic key or transferable ID required
for a program to function. Common variations on this theme have used
parallel or even joystick ports. See
`*dongle-disk* <dongle-disk.html>`__.

3. An adaptor cable mating a special edge-type connector on a PCMCIA or
on-board Ethernet card to a standard 8p8c Ethernet jack. This usage
seems to have surfaced in 1999 and is now dominant. Laptop owners curse
these things because they're notoriously easy to lose and the vendors
commonly charge extortionate prices for replacements.

[Note: in early 1992, advertising copy from Rainbow Technologies (a
manufacturer of dongles) included a claim that the word derived from
“Don Gall”, allegedly the inventor of the device. The company's
receptionist will cheerfully tell you that the story is a myth invented
for the ad copy. Nevertheless, I expect it to haunt my life as a
lexicographer for at least the next ten years. :-( —ESR]

**Don't do that then!**: imp.

[from an old doctor's office joke about a patient with a trivial

the whole system comes to a halt for thirty seconds.” “Don't do that,
then!” (or “So don't do that!”). Compare `*RTFM* <../R/RTFM.html>`__.

Here's a classic example of “Don't do that then!” from Neal Stephenson's
*In The Beginning Was The Command Line*. A friend of his built a network
with a load of Macs and a few high-powered database servers. He found
that from time to time the whole network would lock up for no apparent
reason. The problem was eventually tracked down to MacOS's cooperative
multitasking: when a user held down the mouse button for too long, the
network stack wouldn't get a chance to run...

**dot file**: n.

A file that is not visible by default to normal directory-browsing tools
(on Unix, files named with a leading dot are, by convention, not
normally presented in directory listings). Many programs define one or
more dot files in which startup or configuration information may be
optionally recorded; a user can customize the program's behavior by
creating the appropriate file in the current or home directory.
(Therefore, dot files tend to `*creep* <../C/creep.html>`__ — with every
nontrivial application program defining at least one, a user's home
directory can be filled with scores of dot files, of course without the
user's really being aware of it.) See also

double bucky

D

 `Next <doubled-sig.html>`__

--------------

**double bucky**: adj.

Using both the CTRL and META keys. “The command to burn all LEDs is
double bucky F.”

This term originated on the Stanford extended-ASCII keyboard, and was
later taken up by users of the `*space-cadet
keyboard* <../S/space-cadet-keyboard.html>`__ at MIT. A typical MIT
comment was that the Stanford `*bucky bits* <../B/bucky-bits.html>`__
(control and meta shifting keys) were nice, but there weren't enough of
them; you could type only 512 different characters on a Stanford
keyboard. An obvious way to address this was simply to add more shifting
keys, and this was eventually done; but a keyboard with that many
shifting keys is hard on touch-typists, who don't like to move their
hands away from the home position on the keyboard. It was half-seriously
suggested that the extra shifting keys be implemented as pedals; typing
on such a keyboard would be very much like playing a full pipe organ.
This idea is mentioned in a parody of a very fine song by Jeffrey Moss
called *Rubber Duckie*, which was published in *The Sesame Street
Songbook* (Simon and Schuster 1971, ISBN 0-671-21036-X). These lyrics
were written on May 27, 1978, in celebration of the Stanford keyboard:

| 
|  Double Bucky
| 
|  Double bucky, you're the one!
|  You make my keyboard lots of fun.
|      Double bucky, an additional bit or two:
|  (Vo-vo-de-o!)
|  Control and meta, side by side,
|  Augmented ASCII, nine bits wide!
|      Double bucky!  Half a thousand glyphs, plus a few!
|  Oh,
|  I sure wish that I
|  Had a couple of
|      Bits more!
|  Perhaps a
|  Set of pedals to
|  Make the number of
|      Bits four:
|  Double double bucky!
|  Double bucky, left and right
|  OR'd together, outta sight!
|      Double bucky, I'd like a whole word of
|      Double bucky, I'm happy I heard of
|      Double bucky, I'd like a whole word of you!
|

**down**

1. adj. Not operating. “The up escalator is down” is considered a
humorous thing to say (unless of course you were expecting to use it),
and “The elevator is down” always means “The elevator isn't working” and
never refers to what floor the elevator is on. With respect to
computers, this term has passed into the mainstream; the extension to
other kinds of machine is still confined to techies (e.g. boiler
mechanics may speak of a boiler being down).

2. go down vi. To stop functioning; usually said of the
`*system* <../S/system.html>`__. The message from the
`*console* <../C/console.html>`__ that every hacker hates to hear from
the operator is “System going down in 5 minutes”.

3. take down, bring down vt. To deactivate purposely, usually for repair
work or `*PM* <../P/PM.html>`__. “I'm taking the system down to work on
that bug in the tape drive.” Occasionally one hears the word down by
itself used as a verb in this vt. sense.

Historical use of these terms was at one time associated with transfers

machine categories lost most of their former functional importance.

more specifically known as the ‘Red Dragon Book’ (1986); an earlier
edition, sans Sethi and titled *Principles Of Compiler Design* (Alfred
V. Aho and Jeffrey D. Ullman; Addison-Wesley, 1977; ISBN 0-201-00022-9),
was the \`‘reen Dragon Book’ (1977). (Also New Dragon Book, Old Dragon
Book.) The horsed knight and the Green Dragon were warily eying each
other at a distance; now the knight is typing (wearing gauntlets!) at a
terminal showing a video-game representation of the Red Dragon's head

[MIT] A program similar to a `*daemon* <daemon.html>`__, except that it
is not invoked at all, but is instead used by the system to perform
various secondary tasks. A typical example would be an accounting
program, which keeps track of who is logged in, accumulates load-average
statistics, etc. Under ITS, many terminals displayed a list of people
logged in, where they were, what they were running, etc., along with
some random picture (such as a unicorn, Snoopy, or the Enterprise),
which was generated by the ‘name dragon’. Usage: rare outside MIT —
under Unix and most other OSes this would be called a background demon
or `*daemon* <daemon.html>`__. The best-known Unix example of a dragon
is cron(1). At SAIL, they called this sort of thing a phantom.

**dread high-bit disease**: n.

A condition endemic to some now-obsolete computers and peripherals
(including ASR-33 teletypes and PRIME minicomputers) that results in all
characters having their high (0x80) bit forced on. This of course makes
transporting files to other systems much more difficult, not to mention
the problems these machines have talking with true 8-bit devices.

This term was originally used specifically of PRIME (a.k.a. PR1ME)
minicomputers. Folklore has it that PRIME adopted the reversed-8-bit
convention in order to save 25 cents per serial line per machine; PRIME
old-timers, on the other hand, claim they inherited the disease from
Honeywell via customer NASA's compatibility requirements and struggled
heroically to cure it. Whoever was responsible, this probably qualifies
as one of the most `*cretinous* <../C/cretinous.html>`__ design
tradeoffs ever made. See `*meta bit* <../M/meta-bit.html>`__.

[Stanford] The archetypal man you don't want to see about a problem,
esp. an incompetent professional; a shyster. “Do you know a good eye
doctor?” “Sure, try Mbogo Eye Care and Professional Dry Cleaning.” The
name comes from synergy between `*bogus* <../B/bogus.html>`__ and the
original Dr. Mbogo, a witch doctor who was Gomez Addams' physician on
the old *Addams Family* TV show. Interestingly enough, it turns out that
under the rules for Swahili noun classes, ‘m-’ is the characteristic
prefix of “nouns referring to human beings”. As such, “mbogo” is quite
plausible as a Swahili coinage for a person having the nature of a
`*bogon* <../B/bogon.html>`__. Actually, “mbogo” is indeed a Ki-Swahili
word referring to the African Cape Buffalo, *syncerus caffer*. It is one
of the “big five” dangerous African game animals, and many people with
bush experience believe it to be the most dangerous of them. Compare

**droid**: n.

[from android, SF terminology for a humanoid robot of essentially
biological (as opposed to mechanical/electronic) construction] A person
(esp. a low-level bureaucrat or service-business employee) exhibiting
most of the following characteristics: (a) naive trust in the wisdom of
the parent organization or ‘the system’; (b) a blind-faith propensity to
believe obvious nonsense emitted by authority figures (or computers!);
(c) a rule-governed mentality, one unwilling or unable to look beyond
the ‘letter of the law’ in exceptional situations; (d) a paralyzing fear
of official reprimand or worse if Procedures are not followed No Matter
What; and (e) no interest in doing anything above or beyond the call of
a very narrowly-interpreted duty, or in particular in fixing that which
is broken; an “It's not my job, man” attitude.

Typical droid positions include supermarket checkout assistant and bank
clerk; the syndrome is also endemic in low-level government employees.
The implication is that the rules and official procedures constitute
software that the droid is executing; problems arise when the software
has not been properly debugged. The term droid mentality is also used to
describe the mindset behind this behavior. Compare
`*suit* <../S/suit.html>`__, `*marketroid* <../M/marketroid.html>`__;
see `*-oid* <../O/suffix-oid.html>`__.

In England there is equivalent mainstream slang; a ‘jobsworth’ is an
obstructive, rule-following bureaucrat, often of the uniformed or suited
variety. Named for the habit of denying a reasonable request by sucking
his teeth and saying “Oh no, guv, sorry I can't help you: that's more
than my job's worth”.

--------------

**drunk mouse syndrome**: n.

(also mouse on drugs) A malady exhibited by the mouse pointing device of
some computers. The typical symptom is for the mouse cursor on the
screen to move in random directions and not in sync with the motion of
the actual mouse. Can usually be corrected by unplugging the mouse and
plugging it back again. Another recommended fix for optical mice is to
rotate your mouse pad 90 degrees.

At Xerox PARC in the 1970s, most people kept a can of copier cleaner
(isopropyl alcohol) at their desks. When the steel ball on the mouse had
picked up enough `*cruft* <../C/cruft.html>`__ to be unreliable, the
mouse was doused in cleaner, which restored it for a while. However,
this operation left a fine residue that accelerated the accumulation of
cruft, so the dousings became more and more frequent. Finally, the mouse
was declared ‘alcoholic’ and sent to the clinic to be dried out in a CFC
ultrasonic bath.

**Duff's device**: n.

The most dramatic use yet seen of `*fall
through* <../F/fall-through.html>`__ in C, invented by Tom Duff when he
was at Lucasfilm. Trying to optimize all the instructions he could out
of an inner loop that copied data serially onto an output port, he
decided to unroll it. He then realized that the unrolled version could
be implemented by *interlacing* the structures of a switch and a loop:

+---------+
| .. code |
| :: prog |
| ramlist |
| ing     |
|         |
|         |
| registe |
| r n = ( |
| count + |
|  7) / 8 |
| ;       |
| /* coun |
| t > 0 a |
| ssumed  |
| */      |
|         |
|         |
| switch  |
| (count  |
| % 8)    |
|         |
| {       |
|         |
| case 0: |
|         |
|  do {   |
| *to = * |
| from++; |
|         |
| case 7: |
|         |
|         |
| *to = * |
| from++; |
|         |
| case 6: |
|         |
|         |
| *to = * |
| from++; |
|         |
| case 5: |
|         |
|         |
| *to = * |
| from++; |
|         |
| case 4: |
|         |
|         |
| *to = * |
| from++; |
|         |
| case 3: |
|         |
|         |
| *to = * |
| from++; |
|         |
| case 2: |
|         |
|         |
| *to = * |
| from++; |
|         |
| case 1: |
|         |
|         |
| *to = * |
| from++; |
|         |
|         |
|         |
|      }  |
| while ( |
| --n > 0 |
| );      |
|         |
| }       |
         
+---------+

Shocking though it appears to all who encounter it for the first time,
the device is actually perfectly valid, legal C. C's default `*fall
through* <../F/fall-through.html>`__ in case statements has long been
its most controversial single feature; Duff observed that “This code
forms some sort of argument in that debate, but I'm not sure whether
it's for or against.” Duff has discussed the device in detail at
`http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/duffs-device.html <http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/duffs-device.html>`__.
Note that the omission of postfix **++** from **\*to** was intentional
(though confusing). Duff's device can be used to implement memory copy,
but the original aim was to copy values serially into a magic IO
register.

actually be removed — GLS]

**dumpster diving**: /dump'·ster di:´·ving/, n.

1. The practice of sifting refuse from an office or technical
installation to extract confidential data, especially
security-compromising information (‘dumpster’ is an Americanism for what
is elsewhere called a skip). Back in AT&T's monopoly days, before paper
shredders became common office equipment, phone phreaks (see
`*phreaking* <../P/phreaking.html>`__) used to organize regular dumpster
runs against phone company plants and offices. Discarded and damaged
copies of AT&T internal manuals taught them much. The technique is still
rumored to be a favorite of crackers operating against careless targets.

2. The practice of raiding the dumpsters behind buildings where
producers and/or consumers of high-tech equipment are located, with the
expectation (usually justified) of finding discarded but still-valuable
equipment to be nursed back to health in some hacker's den. Experienced
dumpster-divers not infrequently accumulate basements full of moldering
(but still potentially useful) `*cruft* <../C/cruft.html>`__.

**DWIM**: /dwim/

[acronym, ‘Do What I Mean’]

1. adj. Able to guess, sometimes even correctly, the result intended
when bogus input was provided.

2. n. obs. The BBNLISP/INTERLISP function that attempted to accomplish
this feat by correcting many of the more common errors. See
`*hairy* <../H/hairy.html>`__.

3. Occasionally, an interjection hurled at a balky computer, esp. when
one senses one might be tripping over legalisms (see
`*legalese* <../L/legalese.html>`__).

4. Of a person, someone whose directions are incomprehensible and vague,
but who nevertheless has the expectation that you will solve the problem
using the specific method he/she has in mind.

Warren Teitelman originally wrote DWIM to fix his typos and spelling
errors, so it was somewhat idiosyncratic to his style, and would often
make hash of anyone else's typos if they were stylistically different.
Some victims of DWIM thus claimed that the acronym stood for ‘Damn
Warren’s Infernal Machine!'.

In one notorious incident, Warren added a DWIM feature to the command
interpreter used at Xerox PARC. One day another hacker there typed
**delete \*$** to free up some disk space. (The editor there named
backup files by appending **$** to the original file name, so he was
trying to delete any backup files left over from old editing sessions.)
It happened that there weren't any editor backup files, so DWIM
helpfully reported **\*$ not found, assuming you meant 'delete \*'.** It
then started to delete all the files on the disk! The hacker managed to
stop it with a `*Vulcan nerve pinch* <../V/Vulcan-nerve-pinch.html>`__
after only a half dozen or so files were lost.

The disgruntled victim later said he had been sorely tempted to go to
Warren's office, tie Warren down in his chair in front of his
workstation, and then type **delete \*$** twice.

DWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex
program; it is also occasionally described as the single instruction the
ideal computer would have. Back when proofs of program correctness were
in vogue, there were also jokes about DWIMC (Do What I Mean, Correctly).
A related term, more often seen as a verb, is DTRT (Do The Right Thing);
see `*Right Thing* <../R/Right-Thing.html>`__.
