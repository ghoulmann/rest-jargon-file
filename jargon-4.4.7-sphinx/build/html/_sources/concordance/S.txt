**sacred**: adj.

Reserved for the exclusive use of something (an extension of the
standard meaning). Often means that anyone may look at the sacred
object, but clobbering it will screw whatever it is sacred to. The
comment “Register 7 is sacred to the interrupt handler” appearing in a
program would be interpreted by a hacker to mean that if any *other*
part of the program changes the contents of register 7, dire
consequences are likely to ensue.

**saga**: n.

[WPI] A cuspy but bogus raving story about ``N`` random broken people.

Here is a classic example of the saga form, as told by Guy L. Steele:

    Jon L. White (login name JONL) and I (GLS) were office mates at MIT
    for many years. One April, we both flew from Boston to California
    for a week on research business, to consult face-to-face with some
    people at Stanford, particularly our mutual friend Richard P.
    Gabriel (RPG).

    RPG picked us up at the San Francisco airport and drove us back to
    Palo Alto (going `*logical* <../L/logical.html>`__ south on route
    101, parallel to `*El Camino
    Bignum* <../E/El-Camino-Bignum.html>`__). Palo Alto is adjacent to
    Stanford University and about 40 miles south of San Francisco. We
    ate at The Good Earth, a ‘health food’ restaurant, very popular, the
    sort whose milkshakes all contain honey and protein powder. JONL
    ordered such a shake — the waitress claimed the flavor of the day
    was “lalaberry”. I still have no idea what that might be, but it
    became a running joke. It was the color of raspberry, and JONL said
    it tasted rather bitter. I ate a better tostada there than I have
    ever had in a Mexican restaurant.

    After this we went to the local Uncle Gaylord's Old Fashioned Ice
    Cream Parlor. They make ice cream fresh daily, in a variety of
    intriguing flavors. It's a chain, and they have a slogan: “If you
    don't live near an Uncle Gaylord's — MOVE!” Also, Uncle Gaylord (a
    real person) wages a constant battle to force big-name ice cream
    makers to print their ingredients on the package (like air and
    plastic and other non-natural garbage). JONL and I had first
    discovered Uncle Gaylord's the previous August, when we had flown to
    a computer-science conference in Berkeley, California, the first
    time either of us had been on the West Coast. When not in the
    conference sessions, we had spent our time wandering the length of
    Telegraph Avenue, which (like Harvard Square in Cambridge) was lined
    with picturesque street vendors and interesting little shops. On
    that street we discovered Uncle Gaylord's Berkeley store. The ice
    cream there was very good. During that August visit JONL went
    absolutely bananas (so to speak) over one particular flavor, ginger
    honey.

    Therefore, after eating at The Good Earth — indeed, after every
    lunch and dinner and before bed during our April visit — a trip to
    Uncle Gaylord's (the one in Palo Alto) was mandatory. We had arrived
    on a Wednesday, and by Thursday evening we had been there at least
    four times. Each time, JONL would get ginger honey ice cream, and
    proclaim to all bystanders that “Ginger was the spice that drove the
    Europeans mad! That's why they sought a route to the East! They used
    it to preserve their otherwise off-taste meat.” After the third or
    fourth repetition RPG and I were getting a little tired of this
    spiel, and began to paraphrase him: “Wow! Ginger! The spice that
    makes rotten meat taste good!” “Say! Why don't we find some dog
    that's been run over and sat in the sun for a week and put some
    *ginger* on it for dinner?!” “Right! With a lalaberry shake!” And so
    on. This failed to faze JONL; he took it in good humor, as long as
    we kept returning to Uncle Gaylord's. He loves ginger honey ice
    cream.

    Now RPG and his then-wife KBT (Kathy Tracy) were putting us up
    (putting up with us?) in their home for our visit, so to thank them
    JONL and I took them out to a nice French restaurant of their
    choosing. I unadventurously chose the filet mignon, and KBT had je
    ne sais quoi du jour, but RPG and JONL had lapin (rabbit).
    (Waitress: “Oui, we have fresh rabbit, fresh today.” RPG: “Well,
    JONL, I guess we won't need any *ginger*!”)

    We finished the meal late, about 11PM, which is 2AM Boston time, so
    JONL and I were rather droopy. But it wasn't yet midnight. Off to
    Uncle Gaylord's!

    Now the French restaurant was in Redwood City, north of Palo Alto.
    In leaving Redwood City, we somehow got onto route 101 going north
    instead of south. JONL and I wouldn't have known the difference had
    RPG not mentioned it. We still knew very little of the local
    geography. I did figure out, however, that we were headed in the
    direction of Berkeley, and half-jokingly suggested that we continue
    north and go to Uncle Gaylord's in Berkeley.

    RPG said “Fine!” and we drove on for a while and talked. I was
    drowsy, and JONL actually dropped off to sleep for 5 minutes. When
    he awoke, RPG said, “Gee, JONL, you must have slept all the way over
    the bridge!”, referring to the one spanning San Francisco Bay. Just
    then we came to a sign that said “University Avenue”. I mumbled
    something about working our way over to Telegraph Avenue; RPG said
    “Right!” and maneuvered some more. Eventually we pulled up in front
    of an Uncle Gaylord's.

    Now, I hadn't really been paying attention because I was so sleepy,
    and I didn't really understand what was happening until RPG let me
    in on it a few moments later, but I was just alert enough to notice
    that we had somehow come to the Palo Alto Uncle Gaylord's after all.

    JONL noticed the resemblance to the Palo Alto store, but hadn't
    caught on. (The place is lit with red and yellow lights at night,
    and looks much different from the way it does in daylight.) He said,
    “This isn't the Uncle Gaylord's I went to in Berkeley! It looked
    like a barn! But this place looks *just like* the one back in Palo
    Alto!”

    RPG deadpanned, “Well, this is the one *I* always come to when I'm
    in Berkeley. They've got two in San Francisco, too. Remember,
    they're a chain.”

    JONL accepted this bit of wisdom. And he was not totally ignorant —
    he knew perfectly well that University Avenue was in Berkeley, not
    far from Telegraph Avenue. What he didn't know was that there is a
    completely different University Avenue in Palo Alto.

    JONL went up to the counter and asked for ginger honey. The guy at
    the counter asked whether JONL would like to taste it first,
    evidently their standard procedure with that flavor, as not too many
    people like it.

    JONL said, “I'm sure I like it. Just give me a cone.” The guy behind
    the counter insisted that JONL try just a taste first. “Some people
    think it tastes like soap.” JONL insisted, “Look, I *love* ginger. I
    eat Chinese food. I eat raw ginger roots. I already went through
    this hassle with the guy back in Palo Alto. I *know* I like that
    flavor!”

    At the words “back in Palo Alto” the guy behind the counter got a
    very strange look on his face, but said nothing. KBT caught his eye
    and winked. Through my stupor I still hadn't quite grasped what was
    going on, and thought RPG was rolling on the floor laughing and
    clutching his stomach just because JONL had launched into his spiel
    (“makes rotten meat a dish for princes”) for the forty-third time.
    At this point, RPG clued me in fully.

    RPG, KBT, and I retreated to a table, trying to stifle our chuckles.
    JONL remained at the counter, talking about ice cream with the guy
    b.t.c., comparing Uncle Gaylord's to other ice cream shops and
    generally having a good old time.

    At length the g.b.t.c.: said, “How's the ginger honey?” JONL said,
    “Fine! I wonder what exactly is in it?” Now Uncle Gaylord publishes
    all his recipes and even teaches classes on how to make his ice
    cream at home. So the g.b.t.c.: got out the recipe, and he and JONL
    pored over it for a while. But the g.b.t.c.: could contain his
    curiosity no longer, and asked again, “You really like that stuff,
    huh?” JONL said, “Yeah, I've been eating it constantly back in Palo
    Alto for the past two days. In fact, I think this batch is about as
    good as the cones I got back in Palo Alto!”

    G.b.t.c.: looked him straight in the eye and said, “You're *in* Palo
    Alto!”

    JONL turned slowly around, and saw the three of us collapse in a fit
    of giggles. He clapped a hand to his forehead and exclaimed, “I've
    been hacked!”

[My spies on the West Coast inform me that there is a close relative of
the raspberry found out there called an ‘ollalieberry’ —ESR]

[Ironic footnote: the `*meme* <../M/meme.html>`__ about ginger vs.
rotting meat is an urban legend. It's not borne out by an examination of
medieval recipes or period purchase records for spices, and appears
full-blown in the works of Samuel Pegge, a gourmand and notorious flake
case who originated numerous food myths. The truth seems to be that
ginger was used to cover not rot but the extreme salt taste of meat
packed in brine, which was the best method available before
refrigeration. —ESR]

**salescritter**: /sayls´kri\`tr/, n.

Pejorative hackerism for a computer salesperson. Hackers tell the
following joke:

| 
|  Q. What's the difference between a used-car dealer and a
|     computer salesman?
|  A. The used-car dealer knows he's lying.  [Some versions add:
|     ...and probably knows how to drive.]

This reflects the widespread hacker belief that salescritters are
self-selected for stupidity (after all, if they had brains and the
inclination to use them, they'd be in programming). The terms salesthing
and salesdroid are also common. Compare

Union; now refers by obvious extension to any less-than-official
promulgation of textual material, esp. rare, obsolete, or
never-formally-published computer documentation. Samizdat is obviously
much easier when one has access to high-bandwidth networks and
high-quality laser printers. Note that samizdat is properly used only
with respect to documents which contain needed information (see also
`*hacker ethic* <../H/hacker-ethic.html>`__) but which are for some
reason otherwise unavailable, but *not* in the context of documents
which are available through normal channels, for which unauthorized
duplication would be unethical copyright violation. See `*Lions

**samurai**: n.

A hacker who hires out for legal cracking jobs, snooping for factions in
corporate political fights, lawyers pursuing privacy-rights and First
Amendment cases, and other parties with legitimate reasons to need an
electronic locksmith. In 1991, mainstream media reported the existence
of a loose-knit culture of samurai that meets electronically on BBS
systems, mostly bright teenagers with personal micros; they have modeled
themselves explicitly on the historical samurai of Japan and on the “net
cowboys” of William Gibson's `*cyberpunk* <../C/cyberpunk.html>`__
novels. Those interviewed claim to adhere to a rigid ethic of loyalty to
their employers and to disdain the vandalism and theft practiced by
criminal crackers as beneath them and contrary to the hacker ethic; some
quote Miyamoto Musashi's *Book of Five Rings*, a classic of historical
samurai doctrine, in support of these principles. See also

**sanity check**: n.

[very common]

1. The act of checking a piece of code (or anything else, e.g., a Usenet
posting) for completely stupid mistakes. Implies that the check is to
make sure the author was sane when it was written; e.g., if a piece of
scientific software relied on a particular formula and was giving
unexpected results, one might first look at the nesting of parentheses
or the coding of the formula, as a sanity check, before looking at the
more complex I/O or data structure manipulation routines, much less the
algorithm itself. Compare `*reality check* <../R/reality-check.html>`__.

2. A run-time test, either validating input or ensuring that the program
hasn't screwed up internally (producing an inconsistent value or state).

3. Conversationally, saying “sanity check” means you are requesting a
check of your assumptions. “Wait a minute, sanity check, are we talking
about the same Kevin here?”

A design or implementation bug in a program that doesn't manifest until
someone reading source or using the program in an unusual way notices
that it never should have worked, at which point the program promptly
stops working for everybody until fixed. Though (like `*bit

--------------

**scram switch**: n.

[from the nuclear power industry] An emergency-power-off switch (see
`*Big Red Switch* <../B/Big-Red-Switch.html>`__), esp. one positioned to
be easily hit by evacuating personnel. In general, this is *not*
something you `*frob* <../F/frob.html>`__ lightly; these often initiate
expensive events (such as Halon dumps) and are installed in a `*dinosaur
pen* <../D/dinosaur-pen.html>`__ for use in case of electrical fire or
in case some luckless `*field servoid* <../F/field-servoid.html>`__
should put 120 volts across himself while `*Easter
egging* <../E/Easter-egging.html>`__. (See also
`*molly-guard* <../M/molly-guard.html>`__, `*TMRC* <../T/TMRC.html>`__.)

“Scram” was in origin a backronym for “Safety Cut Rope Axe Man” coined
by Enrico Fermi himself. The story goes that in the earliest nuclear
power experiments the engineers recognized the possibility that the
reactor wouldn't behave exactly as predicted by their mathematical
models. Accordingly, they made sure that they had mechanisms in place
that would rapidly drop the control rods back into the reactor. One
mechanism took the form of ‘scram technicians’. These individuals stood
next to the ropes or cables that raised and lowered the control rods.
Equipped with axes or cable-cutters, these technicians stood ready for
the (literal) ‘scram’ command. If necessary, they would cut the cables,
and gravity would expeditiously return the control rods to the reactor,
thereby averting yet another kind of `*core
dump* <../C/core-dump.html>`__.

Modern reactor control rods are held in place with claw-like devices,
held closed by current. SCRAM switches are circuit breakers that
immediately open the circuit to the rod arms, resulting in the rapid
insertion and subsequent bottoming of the control rods.

**scratch monkey**: n.

As in “Before testing or reconfiguring, always mount a `*scratch
monkey* <scratch-monkey.html>`__\ ”, a proverb used to advise caution
when dealing with irreplaceable data or devices. Used to refer to any
scratch volume hooked to a computer during any risky operation as a
replacement for some precious resource or data that might otherwise get
trashed.

This term preserves the memory of Mabel, the Swimming Wonder Monkey,
star of a biological research program at the University of Toronto.
Mabel was not (so the legend goes) your ordinary monkey; the university
had spent years teaching her how to swim, breathing through a regulator,
in order to study the effects of different gas mixtures on her
physiology. Mabel suffered an untimely demise one day when a
`*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__ `*field circus* <../F/field-circus.html>`__
engineer troubleshooting a crash on the program's
`*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__ inadvertently interfered with some custom
hardware that was wired to Mabel.

It is reported that, after calming down an understandably irate customer
sufficiently to ascertain the facts of the matter, a DEC troubleshooter
called up the `*field circus* <../F/field-circus.html>`__ manager
responsible and asked him sweetly, “Can you swim?” Not all the
consequences to humans were so amusing; the sysop of the machine in
question was nearly thrown in jail at the behest of certain clueless
`*droid* <../D/droid.html>`__\ s at the local ‘humane’ society. The
moral is clear: When in doubt, always mount a scratch monkey. [The
actual incident occured in 1979 or 1980. There is a version of this
story, complete with reported dialogue between one of the project people
and DEC field service, that has been circulating on Internet since 1986.
It is hilarious and mythic, but gets some facts wrong. For example, it
reports the machine as a `*PDP-11* <../P/PDP-11.html>`__ and alleges
that Mabel's demise occurred when DEC `*PM* <../P/PM.html>`__\ ed the
machine. Earlier versions of this entry were based on that story; this
one has been corrected from an interview with the hapless sysop. —ESR]

[Unix] A terminal line which spews an infinite number of random
characters at the operating system. This can happen if the terminal is
either disconnected or connected to a powered-off terminal but still
enabled for login; misconfiguration, misimplementation, or simple bad
luck can start such a terminal screaming. A screaming tty or two can
seriously degrade the performance of a vanilla Unix system; the arriving
“characters” are treated as userid/password pairs and tested as such.
The Unix password encryption algorithm is designed to be computationally
intensive in order to foil brute-force crack attacks, so although none
of the logins succeeds; the overhead of rejecting them all can be
substantial.

**screen scraping**: v.

The act of capturing data from a system or program by snooping the
contents of some display that is not actually intended for data
transport or inspection by programs. Around 1980 this term referred to
tricks like reading the display memory of a smart terminal through its
auxiliary port. Nowadays it often refers to parsing the HTML in
generated web pages with programs designed to mine out particular
patterns of content. In either guise screen-scraping is an ugly, ad-hoc,
last-resort technique that is very likely to break on even minor changes
to the format of the data being snooped.

2. People who cannot program, but who create tacky HTML pages by copying
JavaScript routines from other tacky HTML pages. More generally, a

either having or desiring to have a mental model of what the code does;
someone who thinks of code as magical incantations and asks only “what

**SCSI voodoo**: /skuz´ee voo´doo/

[common among Mac users] `*SCSI* <SCSI.html>`__ interface hardware is
notoriously fickle of temperament. Often, the SCSI bus will fail to work
unless the cable order of devices is re-arranged, SCSI termination is
added or removed (sometimes double-termination or *no* termination will
fix the problem), or particular devices are given particular SCSI IDs.
The skills needed to trick the naturally skittish demons of SCSI into
working are collectively known as SCSI voodoo. Compare

While ordinary mortals frequently experience near-terminal frustration
when attempting to configure SCSI device chains, it is said that a true

**secondary damage**: n.

When a fatal error occurs (esp. a `*segfault* <segfault.html>`__) the
immediate cause may be that a pointer has been trashed due to a previous
`*fandango on core* <../F/fandango-on-core.html>`__. However, this
fandango may have been due to an *earlier* fandango, so no amount of
analysis will reveal (directly) how the damage occurred. “The data
structure was clobbered, but it was secondary damage.” By extension, the
corruption resulting from ``N`` cascaded fandangoes on core is
‘\ ``N``\ th-level damage’. There is at least one case on record in
which 17 hours of `*grovel* <../G/grovel.html>`__\ ling with **adb**
actually dug up the underlying bug behind an instance of seventh-level
damage! The hacker who accomplished this near-superhuman feat was
presented with an award by his fellows.

**second-system effect**: n.

(sometimes, more euphoniously, second-system syndrome) When one is
designing the successor to a relatively small, elegant, and successful
system, there is a tendency to become grandiose in one's success and
design an `*elephantine* <../E/elephantine.html>`__ feature-laden
monstrosity. The term was first used by Fred Brooks in his classic *The
Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering* (Addison-Wesley,
1975; ISBN 0-201-00650-2). It described the jump from a set of nice,
simple operating systems on the IBM 70xx series to OS/360 on the 360
series. A similar effect can also happen in an evolving system; see
`*Brooks's Law* <../B/Brookss-Law.html>`__, `*creeping
elegance* <../C/creeping-elegance.html>`__, `*creeping
featurism* <../C/creeping-featurism.html>`__. See also

`*X* <../X/X.html>`__, `*software bloat* <software-bloat.html>`__.

This version of the jargon lexicon has been described (with altogether
too much truth for comfort) as an example of second-system effect run
amok on jargon-1....

security through obscurity

`Prev <secondary-damage.html>`__ 

S

--------------

**security through obscurity**

(alt.: security by obscurity) A term applied by hackers to most OS
vendors' favorite way of coping with security holes — namely, ignoring
them, documenting neither any known holes nor the underlying security
algorithms, trusting that nobody will find out about them and that
people who do find out about them won't exploit them. This “strategy”
never works for long and occasionally sets the world up for debacles
like the `*RTM* <../R/RTM.html>`__ worm of 1988 (see `*Great
Worm* <../G/Great-Worm.html>`__), but once the brief moments of panic
created by such events subside most vendors are all too willing to turn
over and go back to sleep. After all, actually fixing the bugs would
siphon off the resources needed to implement the next user-interface
frill on marketing's wish list — and besides, if they started fixing
security bugs customers might begin to *expect* it and imagine that
their warranties of merchantability gave them some sort of *right* to a
system with fewer holes in it than a shotgunned Swiss cheese, and *then*
where would we be?

Historical note: There are conflicting stories about the origin of this
term. It has been claimed that it was first used in the Usenet newsgroup
``comp.sys.apollo`` during a campaign to get HP/Apollo to fix security
problems in its Unix-`*clone* <../C/clone.html>`__ Aegis/DomainOS (they
didn't change a thing). `*ITS* <../I/ITS.html>`__ fans, on the other
hand, say it was coined years earlier in opposition to the incredibly
paranoid `*Multics* <../M/Multics.html>`__ people down the hall, for
whom security was everything. In the ITS culture it referred to (1) the
fact that by the time a tourist figured out how to make trouble he'd
generally gotten over the urge to make it, because he felt part of the
community; and (2) (self-mockingly) the poor coverage of the
documentation and obscurity of many commands. One instance of
*deliberate* security through obscurity is recorded; the command to
allow patching the running ITS system (escape escape control-R) echoed
as $$^D. If you actually typed alt alt ^D, that set a flag that would
prevent patching the system even if you later got it right.

with a segmentation violation error. This is often caused by improper
usage of pointers in the source code, dereferencing a null pointer, or

**September that never ended**

All time since September 1993. One of the seasonal rhythms of the Usenet
used to be the annual September influx of clueless newbies who, lacking
any sense of `*netiquette* <../N/netiquette.html>`__, made a general
nuisance of themselves. This coincided with people starting college,
getting their first internet accounts, and plunging in without bothering
to learn what was acceptable. These relatively small drafts of newbies
could be assimilated within a few months. But in September 1993, AOL
users became able to post to Usenet, nearly overwhelming the old-timers'
capacity to acculturate them; to those who nostalgically recall the
period before, this triggered an inexorable decline in the quality of
discussions on newsgroups. Syn. eternal September. See also

SEX

**SEX**: /seks/

[Sun Users' Group & elsewhere] n.

1. Software EXchange. A technique invented by the blue-green algae
hundreds of millions of years ago to speed up their evolution, which had
been terribly slow up until then. Today, SEX parties are popular among
hackers and others (of course, these are no longer limited to exchanges
of genetic software). In general, SEX parties are a `*Good
Thing* <../G/Good-Thing.html>`__, but unprotected SEX can propagate a
`*virus* <../V/virus.html>`__. See also `*pubic
directory* <../P/pubic-directory.html>`__.

2. The rather Freudian mnemonic often used for Sign EXtend, a machine
instruction found in the `*PDP-11* <../P/PDP-11.html>`__ and many other
architectures. The RCA 1802 chip used in the early Elf and SuperElf
personal computers had a ‘SEt X register’ SEX instruction, but this
seems to have had little folkloric impact. The Data General instruction
set also had **SEX**.

`*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__'s engineers nearly got a
`*PDP-11* <../P/PDP-11.html>`__ assembler that used the **SEX** mnemonic
out the door at one time, but (for once) marketing wasn't asleep and
forced a change. That wasn't the last time this happened, either. The
author of *The Intel 8086 Primer*, who was one of the original designers
of the 8086, noted that there was originally a **SEX** instruction on
that processor, too. He says that Intel management got cold feet and
decreed that it be changed, and thus the instruction was renamed **CBW**
and **CWD** (depending on what was being extended). Amusingly, the Intel
8048 (the microcontroller used in IBM PC keyboards) is also missing
straight **SEX** but has logical-or and logical-and instructions **ORL**
and **ANL**.

The Motorola 6809, used in the Radio Shack Color Computer and in U.K.'s
‘Dragon 32’ personal computer, actually had an official **SEX**
instruction; the 6502 in the Apple II with which it competed did not.
British hackers thought this made perfect mythic sense; after all, it
was commonly observed, you could (on some theoretical level) have sex
with a dragon, but you can't have sex with an apple.

**sharchive**: /shar´ki:v/, n.

[Unix and Usenet; from /bin/sh archive] A
`*flatten* <../F/flatten.html>`__\ ed representation of a set of one or
more files, with the unique property that it can be unflattened (the
original files restored) by feeding it through a standard Unix shell;
thus, a sharchive can be distributed to anyone running Unix, and no
special unpacking software is required. Sharchives are also intriguing
in that they are typically created by shell scripts; the script that
produces sharchives is thus a script which produces self-unpacking
scripts, which may themselves contain scripts. Sharchives are also
commonly referred to as ‘shar files’ after the name of the most common
program for generating them.

The downsides of sharchives are that they are an ideal venue for
`*Trojan horse* <../T/Trojan-horse.html>`__ attacks and that, for
recipients not running Unix, no simple un-sharchiving program is
possible; sharchives can and do make use of arbitrarily-powerful shell
features. For these reasons, this technique has largely fallen out of
use since the mid-1990s.

**sharing violation**

[From a file error common to several `*OS* <../O/OS.html>`__\ es] A
response to receiving information, typically of an excessively personal
nature, that you were probably happier not knowing. “You know those
little noises that Pat makes in bed?” “Whoa! Sharing violation!” In
contrast to the original file error, which indicated that you were *not*
being given data that you *did* want.

shell

--------------

**shell**: n.

[orig. `*Multics* <../M/Multics.html>`__ techspeak, widely propagated
via Unix]

1. [techspeak] The command interpreter used to pass commands to an
operating system; so called because it is the part of the operating
system that interfaces with the outside world.

2. More generally, any interface program that mediates access to a
special resource or `*server* <server.html>`__ for convenience,
efficiency, or security reasons; for this meaning, the usage is usually
a shell around whatever. This sort of program is also called a wrapper.

3. A skeleton program, created by hand or by another program (like, say,
a parser generator), which provides the necessary
`*incantation* <../I/incantation.html>`__\ s to set up some task and the
control flow to drive it (the term `*driver* <../D/driver.html>`__ is
sometimes used synonymously). The user is meant to fill in whatever code
is needed to get real work done. This usage is common in the AI and
Microsoft Windows worlds, and confuses Unix hackers.

Historical note: Apparently, the original Multics shell (sense 1) was so
called because it was a shell (sense 3); it ran user programs not by
starting up separate processes, but by dynamically linking the programs
into its own code, calling them as subroutines, and then dynamically
de-linking them on return. The VMS command interpreter still does
something very like this.

1. A small piece of data inserted in order to achieve a desired memory
alignment or other addressing property. For example, the
`*PDP-11* <../P/PDP-11.html>`__ Unix linker, in split I&D (instructions
and data) mode, inserts a two-byte shim at location 0 in data space so
that no data object will have an address of 0 (and be confused with the
C null pointer). See also `*loose bytes* <../L/loose-bytes.html>`__.

2. A type of small transparent image inserted into HTML documents by
certain WYSIWYG HTML editors, used to set the spacing of elements meant
to have a fixed positioning within a TABLE or DIVision. Hackers who work
on the HTML code of such pages afterwards invariably curse these for
their crocky dependence on the particular spacing of original image
file, the editor that generated them, and the version of the browser
used to view them. Worse, they are a poorly designed
`*kludge* <../K/kludge.html>`__ which the advent of Cascading Style
Sheets makes wholly unnecessary; Any fool can plainly see that use of
borders, layers and positioned elements is the Right Thing (or would be

[MUD: from H. P. Lovecraft's evil fictional deity Shub-Niggurath, the
Black Goat with a Thousand Young] The harsh personification of the
Internet: Beast of a Thousand Processes, Eater of Characters, Avatar of
Line Noise, and Imp of Call Waiting; the hideous multi-tendriled entity
formed of all the manifold connections of the net. A sect of MUDders
worships Shub-Internet, sacrificing objects and praying for good
connections. To no avail — its purpose is malign and evil, and it is the
cause of all network slowdown. Often heard as in “Freela casts a tac
nuke at Shub-Internet for slowing her down.” (A forged response often
follows along the lines of: “Shub-Internet gulps down the tac nuke and
burps happily.”) Also cursed by users of the Web, FTP and telnet when
the network lags. The dread name of Shub-Internet is seldom spoken
aloud, as it is said that repeating it three times will cause the being
to wake, deep within its lair beneath the Pentagon. Compare `*Random
Number God* <../R/Random-Number-God.html>`__.

[January 1996: It develops that one of the computer administrators in
the basement of the Pentagon read this entry and fell over laughing. As
a result, you too can now poke Shub-Internet by

even source code for small programs about which the author wishes to
make a statement; but many consider large sigs a waste of

size of one's sig block is usually inversely proportional to one's

**sitename**: /si:t´naym/, n.

[Unix/Internet] The unique electronic name of a computer system, used to

creativity and humor they often display. Interpreting a sitename is not
unlike interpreting a vanity license plate; one has to mentally unpack
it, allowing for mono-case and length restrictions and the lack of
whitespace. Hacker tradition deprecates dull, institutional-sounding
names in favor of punchy, humorous, and clever coinages (except that it
is considered appropriate for the official public gateway machine of an
organization to bear the organization's name or acronym). Mythological
references, cartoon characters, animal names, and allusions to SF or
fantasy literature are probably the most popular sources for sitenames

slop

--------------

**slop**: n.

1. A one-sided `*fudge factor* <../F/fudge-factor.html>`__, that is, an
allowance for error but in only one of two directions. For example, if
you need a piece of wire 10 feet long and have to guess when you cut it,
you make very sure to cut it too long, by a large amount if necessary,
rather than too short by even a little bit, because you can always cut
off the slop but you can't paste it back on again. When discrete
quantities are involved, slop is often introduced to avoid the
possibility of being on the losing side of a `*fencepost
error* <../F/fencepost-error.html>`__.

2. The percentage of ‘extra’ code generated by a compiler over the size
of equivalent assembler code produced by
`*hand-hacking* <../H/hand-hacking.html>`__; i.e., the space (or maybe
time) you lose because you didn't do it yourself. This number is often
used as a measure of the goodness of a compiler; slop below 5% is very
good, and 10% is usually acceptable. With modern compiler technology,
esp. on RISC machines, the compiler's slop may actually be *negative*;
that is, humans may be unable to generate code as good. This is one of
the reasons assembler programming is no longer common.

smart terminal

S

--------------

**smart terminal**: n.

1. A terminal that has enough computing capability to render graphics or
to offload some kind of front-end processing from the computer it talks
to. The development of workstations and personal computers has made this
term and the product it describes semi-obsolescent, but one may still
hear variants of the phrase act like a smart terminal used to describe
the behavior of workstations or PCs with respect to programs that
execute almost entirely out of a remote `*server* <server.html>`__'s
storage, using local devices as displays.

2. obs. Any terminal with an addressable cursor; the opposite of a
`*glass tty* <../G/glass-tty.html>`__. Today, a terminal with merely an
addressable cursor, but with none of the more-powerful features
mentioned in sense 1, is called a `*dumb
terminal* <../D/dumb-terminal.html>`__.

There is a classic quote from Rob Pike (inventor of the
`*blit* <../B/blit.html>`__ terminal): “A smart terminal is not a
smart\ *ass* terminal, but rather a terminal you can educate.” This
illustrates a common design problem: The attempt to make peripherals (or
anything else) intelligent sometimes results in finicky, rigid ‘special
features’ that become just so much dead weight if you try to use the
device in any way the designer didn't anticipate. Flexibility and
programmability, on the other hand, are *really* smart. Compare
`*hook* <../H/hook.html>`__.

“They claim their new box cranks 50 MIPS for under $5000, but didn't

phrase, popularized by newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin c.1975, has
been said to derive from carnie slang for magic acts and ‘freak show’
displays that depend on *trompe l'oeil* effects, but also calls to mind
the fierce Aztec god Tezcatlipoca (lit. “Smoking Mirror”) for whom the
hearts of huge numbers of human sacrificial victims were regularly cut
out. Upon hearing about a rigged demo or yet another round of

**smoking clover**: n.

[ITS] A `*display hack* <../D/display-hack.html>`__ originally due to
Bill Gosper. Many convergent lines are drawn on a color monitor in such
a way that every pixel struck has its color incremented. The lines all
have one endpoint in the middle of the screen; the other endpoints are
spaced one pixel apart around the perimeter of a large square. The color
map is then repeatedly rotated. This results in a striking,
rainbow-hued, shimmering four-leaf clover. Gosper joked about keeping it
hidden from the FDA (the U.S.'s Food and Drug Administration) lest its
hallucinogenic properties cause it to be banned.

**smoot**: /smoot/, n.

[MIT] A unit of length equal five feet seven inches. The length of the
Harvard Bridge in Boston is famously 364.4 smoots plus an ear (the ear
is allegedly the width of the earhole in the side of the football helmet
the victim was wearing when he was rolled over the bridge). This legend
began with a fraternity prank in 1958 during which the body length of
Oliver Smoot (class of '62) was actually used to measure out that
distance. It is commemorated by smoot marks that MIT students repaint
every few years; the tradition even survived the demolition and
rebuilding of the bridge in the late 1980s. The Boston police have been
known to use smoot markers to indicate accident locations on the bridge.
Apparently Smoot's experience as a unit of measurement led to a
life-long career; he eventually became Chairman of the Board of the
American National Standards Institute, and later President of the
International Organization for Standardization.

ironically to imply that a difficult problem can be easily solved

easy to enhance a FORTRAN compiler to compile COBOL as well; it's just a

--------------

**smurf**: /smerf/, n.

1. [from the ``soc.motss`` newsgroup on Usenet, after some obnoxiously
gooey cartoon characters] A newsgroup regular with a habitual style that
is irreverent, silly, and cute. Like many other hackish terms for
people, this one may be praise or insult depending on who uses it. In
general, being referred to as a smurf is probably not going to make your
day unless you've previously adopted the label yourself in a spirit of
irony. Compare `*old fart* <../O/old-fart.html>`__.

2. [techspeak] A ping packet with a forged source address sent to some
other network's broadcast address. All the machines on the destination
network will send a ping response to the forged source address (the
victim). This both overloads the victim's network and hides the location
of the attacker.

SNAFU principle

 `Next <snail.html>`__

--------------

**SNAFU principle**: /sna´foo prin´si·pl/, n.

[from a WWII Army ac­ro­nym for ‘Situation Normal, All Fucked Up’] “True
communication is possible only between equals, because inferiors are
more consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant lies
than for telling the truth.:” — a central tenet of
`*Discordianism* <../D/Discordianism.html>`__, often invoked by hackers
to explain why authoritarian hierarchies screw up so reliably and
systematically. The effect of the SNAFU principle is a progressive
disconnection of decision-makers from reality. This lightly adapted
version of a fable dating back to the early 1960s illustrates the
phenomenon perfectly:

| 
|  In the beginning was the plan,
|         and then the specification;
|  And the plan was without form,
|         and the specification was void.
| 
|  And darkness
|         was on the faces of the implementors thereof;
|  And they spake unto their leader,
|         saying:
|  “It is a crock of shit,
|         and smells as of a sewer.”
| 
|  And the leader took pity on them,
|         and spoke to the project leader:
|  “It is a crock of excrement,
|         and none may abide the odor thereof.”
| 
|  And the project leader
|         spake unto his section head, saying:
|  “It is a container of excrement,
|         and it is very strong, such that none may abide it.”
| 
|  The section head then hurried to his department manager,
|         and informed him thus:
|  “It is a vessel of fertilizer,
|         and none may abide its strength.”
| 
|  The department manager carried these words
|        to his general manager,
|  and spoke unto him
|        saying:
|  “It containeth that which aideth the growth of plants,
|        and it is very strong.”
| 
|  And so it was that the general manager rejoiced
|        and delivered the good news unto the Vice President.
|  “It promoteth growth,
|        and it is very powerful.”
| 
|  The Vice President rushed to the President's side,
|        and joyously exclaimed:
|  “This powerful new software product
|        will promote the growth of the company!”
| 
|  And the President looked upon the product,
|        and saw that it was very good.

After the subsequent and inevitable disaster, the
`*suit* <suit.html>`__\ s protect themselves by saying “I was
misinformed!”, and the implementors are demoted or fired. Compare

**snail-mail**: n.

Paper mail, as opposed to electronic. Sometimes written as the single
word ‘SnailMail’. One's postal address is, correspondingly, a snail
address. Derives from earlier coinage *‘USnail*\ ’ (from ‘U.S. Mail’),
for which there have even been parody posters and stamps made. Also
(less commonly) called P-mail, from ‘paper mail’ or ‘physical mail’.
Oppose `*email* <../E/email.html>`__.

(Note: Actual garden snails progress at about 10 meters per hour, which
is about 25-50 times slower than the U.K.'s Royal Mail; comparable
measurements for other countries have not yet been made. More
biologically apt terms might be “sloth-mail” at 250 m/hr or
“tortoise-mail” at 270 m/hr. See

snap

`Prev <snail-mail.html>`__ 

S

 `Next <snarf.html>`__

--------------

**snap**: v.

To replace a pointer to a pointer with a direct pointer; to replace an
old address with the forwarding address found there. If you telephone
the main number for an institution and ask for a particular person by
name, the operator may tell you that person's extension before
connecting you, in the hopes that you will snap your pointer and dial
direct next time. The underlying metaphor may be that of a rubber band
stretched through a number of intermediate points; if you remove all the
thumbtacks in the middle, it snaps into a straight line from first to
last. See `*chase pointers* <../C/chase-pointers.html>`__.

Often, the behavior of a `*trampoline* <../T/trampoline.html>`__ is to
perform an error check once and then snap the pointer that invoked it so
as henceforth to bypass the trampoline (and its one-shot error check).
In this context one also speaks of snapping links. For example, in a
LISP implementation, a function interface trampoline might check to make
sure that the caller is passing the correct number of arguments; if it
is, and if the caller and the callee are both compiled, then snapping
the link allows that particular path to use a direct procedure-call
instruction with no further overhead.

**software laser**: n.

An optical laser works by bouncing photons back and forth between two
mirrors, one totally reflective and one partially reflective. If the
lasing material (usually a crystal) has the right properties, photons
scattering off the atoms in the crystal will excite cascades of more
photons, all in lockstep. Eventually the beam will escape through the
partially-reflective mirror. One kind of `*sorcerer's apprentice
mode* <sorcerers-apprentice-mode.html>`__ involving `*bounce
message* <../B/bounce-message.html>`__\ s can produce closely analogous
results, with a `*cascade* <../C/cascade.html>`__ of messages escaping
to flood nearby systems. By mid-1993 there had been at least two
publicized incidents of this kind.

software rot

`Prev <software-laser.html>`__

--------------

**software rot**: n.

Term used to describe the tendency of software that has not been used in
a while to `*lose* <../L/lose.html>`__; such failure may be
semi-humorously ascribed to `*bit rot* <../B/bit-rot.html>`__. More
commonly, software rot strikes when a program's assumptions become out
of date. If the design was insufficiently
`*robust* <../R/robust.html>`__, this may cause it to fail in mysterious
ways. Syn. code rot. See also `*link rot* <../L/link-rot.html>`__.

For example, owing to endemic shortsightedness in the design of COBOL
programs, a good number of them succumbed to software rot when their
2-digit year counters underwent `*wrap
around* <../W/wrap-around.html>`__ at the beginning of the year 2000.
Actually, related lossages often afflict centenarians who have to deal
with computer software designed by unimaginative clods. One such
incident became the focus of a minor public flap in 1990, when a
gentleman born in 1889 applied for a driver's license renewal in
Raleigh, North Carolina. The new system refused to issue the card,
probably because with 2-digit years the ages 101 and 1 cannot be
distinguished.

Historical note: Software rot in an even funnier sense than the mythical
one was a real problem on early research computers (e.g., the R1; see
`*grind crank* <../G/grind-crank.html>`__). If a program that depended
on a peculiar instruction hadn't been run in quite a while, the user
might discover that the opcodes no longer did the same things they once
did. (“Hey, so-and-so needs an instruction to do such-and-such. We can
`*snarf* <snarf.html>`__ this opcode, right? No one uses it.”) Another
classic example of this sprang from the time an MIT hacker found a
simple way to double the speed of the unconditional jump instruction on
a PDP-6, so he patched the hardware. Unfortunately, this broke some
fragile timing software in a music-playing program, throwing its output
out of tune. This was fixed by adding a defensive initialization routine
to compare the speed of a timing loop with the real-time clock; in other
words, it figured out how fast the PDP-6 was that day, and corrected
appropriately.

space-cadet keyboard

`Prev <source-of-all-good-bits.html>`__

--------------

**space-cadet keyboard**: n.

A now-legendary device used on MIT LISP machines, which inspired several
still-current jargon terms and influenced the design of
`*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__. It was equipped with no fewer than
*seven* shift keys: four keys for `*bucky
bits* <../B/bucky-bits.html>`__ (‘control’, ‘meta’, ‘hyper’, and
‘super’) and three regular shift keys, called ‘shift’, ‘top’, and
‘front’. Many keys had three symbols on them: a letter and a symbol on
the top, and a Greek letter on the front. For example, the ‘L’ key had
an ‘L’ and a two-way arrow on the top, and the Greek letter lambda on
the front. By pressing this key with the right hand while playing an
appropriate ‘chord’ with the left hand on the shift keys, you could get
the following results:

+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| L               | lowercase l                       |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| shift-L         | uppercase L                       |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| front-L         | λ                                 |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| front-shift-L   | Λ                                 |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------+
| top-L           | ⇔ (front and shift are ignored)   |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------+

And of course each of these might also be typed with any combination of
the control, meta, hyper, and super keys. On this keyboard, you could
type over 8000 different characters! This allowed the user to type very
complicated mathematical text, and also to have thousands of
single-character commands at his disposal. The keyboard of the Symbolics
Lisp machine was a simplified version, lacking Top and Front keys, that
could only send about 2000 characters.

Many hackers were actually willing to memorize the command meanings of
that many characters if it reduced typing time (this attitude obviously
shaped the interface of EMACS). Other hackers, however, thought having
that many bucky bits was overkill, and objected that such a keyboard can
require three or four hands to operate. See `*bucky
bits* <../B/bucky-bits.html>`__,
`*cokebottle* <../C/cokebottle.html>`__, `*double
bucky* <../D/double-bucky.html>`__, `*meta bit* <../M/meta-bit.html>`__,
`*quadruple bucky* <../Q/quadruple-bucky.html>`__.

(Some relatively bad photographs of the earlier, more elaborate version
are `available on the
Web.) <http://screenshots.sourceforge.net/misc/SpaceCadet.html>`__.

Note: early versions of this entry incorrectly identified the
space-cadet keyboard with the Knight keyboard. Though both were designed
by Tom Knight, the latter term was properly applied only to a keyboard
used for ITS on the PDP-10 and modeled on the Stanford keyboard (as
described under `*bucky bits* <../B/bucky-bits.html>`__). The true
space-cadet keyboard evolved from the first Knight keyboard.

**spamblock**: /spam´blok/, n.

[poss. by analogy to sunblock] Text inserted in an email address to
render it invalid and thus useless to spammers. For example, the address
``<jrandom@hacker.org>`` might be transformed to
``<jrandom@NOSPAM.hacker.org>``. Adding spamblock to an address is often
referred to as munging it (see `*munge* <../M/munge.html>`__). This
evasion tactic depends on the fact that most spammers collect names with
some sort of `*address harvester* <../A/address-harvester.html>`__ on
volumes too high to de-mung by hand, but individual humans reading an
email message can readily spot and remove a spamblock in the From
address.

Note: This is not actually a very effective tactic, and may already be
passing out of use in early 1999 after about two years of life. In both
mail and news, it's essentially impossible to keep a smart address
harvester from mining out the addresses in the message header and trace
lines. Therefore the only people who can be protected are third parties
mentioned by email address in the message — not a common enough case to
interest spammers.

**spam**: vt.,vi.,n.

[from *Monty Python's Flying Circus*]

1. To crash a program by overrunning a fixed-size buffer with
excessively large input data. See also `*buffer
overflow* <../B/buffer-overflow.html>`__, `*overrun
screw* <../O/overrun-screw.html>`__, `*smash the
stack* <smash-the-stack.html>`__.

2. To cause a newsgroup to be flooded with irrelevant or inappropriate
messages. You can spam a newsgroup with as little as one well- (or ill-)
planned message (e.g. asking “What do you think of abortion?” on
``soc.women``). This is often done with
`*cross-post* <../C/cross-post.html>`__\ ing (e.g. any message which is
cross-posted to ``alt.rush-limbaugh`` and ``alt.politics.homosexuality``
will almost inevitably spam both groups). This overlaps with
`*troll* <../T/troll.html>`__ behavior; the latter more specific term
has become more common.

3. To send many identical or nearly-identical messages separately to a
large number of Usenet newsgroups. This is more specifically called ECP,
Excessive Cross-Posting. This is one sure way to infuriate nearly
everyone on the Net. See also `*velveeta* <../V/velveeta.html>`__ and
`*jello* <../J/jello.html>`__.

4. To bombard a newsgroup with multiple copies of a message. This is
more specifically called EMP, Excessive Multi-Posting.

5. To mass-mail unrequested identical or nearly-identical email
messages, particularly those containing advertising. Especially used
when the mail addresses have been culled from network traffic or
databases without the consent of the recipients. Synonyms include
`*UCE* <../U/UCE.html>`__, `*UBE* <../U/UBE.html>`__. As a noun, ‘spam’
refers to the messages so sent.

6. Any large, annoying, quantity of output. For instance, someone on IRC
who walks away from their screen and comes back to find 200 lines of
text might say “Oh no, spam”.

The later definitions have become much more prevalent as the Internet
has opened up to non-techies, and to most people senses 3 4 and 5 are
now primary. All three behaviors are considered abuse of the net, and
are almost universally grounds for termination of the originator's email
account or network connection. In these senses the term ‘spam’ has gone
mainstream, though without its original sense or folkloric freight —
there is apparently a widespread myth among
`*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__\ s that “spamming” is what happens when
you dump cans of Spam into a revolving fan. Hormel, the makers of Spam,
have published a surprisingly enlightened `position
statement <http://www.spam.com/ci/ci_in.htm>`__ on the Internet usage.

**speed of light**

The absolutely fastest a particular algorithm or application could be
implemented, given a set of constraints that are assumed to be
unchangeable. For example, “This would take 60 microseconds without any
processing whatsoever, so that's the speed of light.” However, as one
brilliant hacker once commented: “Remember that the speed of light only
is constant if you can't redesign the universe.”

--------------

**speedometer**: n.

A pattern of lights displayed on a linear set of LEDs (today) or nixie
tubes (yesterday, on ancient mainframes). The pattern is shifted left
every ``N`` times the operating system goes through its `*main
loop* <../M/main-loop.html>`__. A swiftly moving pattern indicates that
the system is mostly idle; the speedometer slows down as the system
becomes overloaded. The speedometer on Sun Microsystems hardware bounces
back and forth like the eyes on one of the Cylons from the wretched
*Battlestar Galactica* TV series.

Historical note: One computer, the GE 600 (later Honeywell 6000)
actually had an *analog* speedometer on the front panel, calibrated in
instructions executed per second.

Keywords embedded (usually invisibly) into a web page to attract search

web page is to insure that the page appears high on the list of matching

this; the right way is a discreet ‘meta keywords’ tag, the wrong way is
to embed many repeats of a keyword in comments (and many search engines
now detect and ignore the latter).

2. Said sarcastically of a program that is perceived to have little more

depends delicately on tone of voice and context. This word was common
mainstream slang during the 1940s, in a sense close to 1.

**spike**: v.

1. To defeat a selection mechanism by introducing a (sometimes
temporary) device that forces a specific result. The word is used in
several industries; telephone engineers refer to spiking a relay by
inserting a pin to hold the relay in either the closed or open state,
and railroaders refer to spiking a track switch so that it cannot be
moved. In programming environments it normally refers to a temporary
change, usually for testing purposes (as opposed to a permanent change,
which would be called `*hardwired* <../H/hardwired.html>`__).

2. [borderline techspeak] A visible peak in an otherwise rather constant
graph (e.g. a sudden surge in line voltage, an unexpected short “high”
on a logical line in a circuit). Hackers frequently use this for a
sudden short increase in some quantity such as system load or network
traffic.

[UK]

1. A lower form of life found on `*talker
system* <../T/talker-system.html>`__\ s and
`*MUD* <../M/MUD.html>`__\ s. The spod has few friends in
`*RL* <../R/RL.html>`__ and uses talkers instead, finding communication
easier and preferable over the net. He has all the negative traits of
the computer geek without having any interest in computers per se.
Lacking any knowledge of or interest in how networks work, and
considering his access a God-given right, he is a major irritant to
sysadmins, clogging up lines in order to reach new MUDs, following
passed-on instructions on how to sneak his way onto Internet (“Wow! It's
in America!”) and complaining when he is not allowed to use busy routes.
A true spod will start any conversation with “Are you male or female?”
(and follow it up with “Got any good numbers/IDs/passwords?”) and will
not talk to someone physically present in the same terminal room until
they log onto the same machine that he is using and enter talk mode.

d00dz* <../W/warez-d00dz.html>`__.

2. A `*backronym* <../B/backronym.html>`__ for “Sole Purpose, Obtain a
Degree”; according to some self-described spods, this term is used by
indifferent students to condemn their harder-working fellows. Compare
the defiant adoption of the term `*geek* <../G/geek.html>`__ in the
mid-1990s by people who would previously have been stigmatized by it.
Spods in the positive sense are talker users who've accumulated a large
amount of spod time, that is, they spend a lot of time logged in to that
talker (for example, my spod time on Uberworld as of this moment is 131
days, 15 hours and 20 minutes). Spods are generally highly knowledgeable
about talkers and SGXStalker coding, as well as computers and the
internet in general.

3. [Glasgow University] An otherwise competent hacker who spends way too
much time on talker systems.

4. [obs.] An ordinary person; a `*random* <../R/random.html>`__. This is
the meaning with which the term was coined, but the inventor informs us
he has himself accepted sense 1.

forms compounds like total spoiler, quasi-spoiler and even
pseudo-spoiler.

Microsoft Windows XP. Some `*back door* <../B/back-door.html>`__

installation. In this situation, the computer system is said to have

stack

--------------

**stack**: n.

The set of things a person has to do in the future. One speaks of the
next project to be attacked as having risen to the top of the stack.
“I'm afraid I've got real work to do, so this'll have to be pushed way
down on my stack.” “I haven't done it yet because every time I pop my
stack something new gets pushed.” If you are interrupted several times
in the middle of a conversation, “My stack overflowed” means “I forget
what we were talking about.” The implication is that more items were
pushed onto the stack than could be remembered, so the least recent
items were lost. The usual physical example of a stack is to be found in
a cafeteria: a pile of plates or trays sitting on a spring in a well, so
that when you put one on the top they all sink down, and when you take
one off the top the rest spring up a bit. See also
`*push* <../P/push.html>`__ and `*pop* <../P/pop.html>`__.

(*The Art of Computer Programming*, second edition, vol. 1, p. 236)
says:

    Many people who realized the importance of stacks and queues
    independently have given other names to these structures: stacks
    have been called push-down lists, reversion storages, cellars,
    nesting stores, piles, last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) lists, and even
    yo-yo lists!

The term “stack” was originally coined by Edsger Dijkstra, who was quite
proud of it.

[University of York, England] To replace a user's encrypted password in

a punishment, e.g. “Graham was starred out for playing Omega in working

gronk out”, or “hungry”. Another standard question is “What's the state
of the world?”, meaning “What's new?” or “What's going on?”. The more

[Apple employees and users] Terminated, said of a development project.
Originated after Steven P. Jobs returned to Apple as acting CEO in 1997.
Jobs immediated axed several development projects, including OpenDoc and
Newton that had been launched by John Sculley, the man who had ousted
Jobs in the mid 1980s. Now any project shut down at Apple and often at
any large firm connected with Apple may be said to have gotten steved.
It is usually spelled lowercase despite the origin. It is almost always
past-tense and used quasi-adjectivally.

[scientific computing] Said of a sequence of memory reads and writes to
addresses, each of which is separated from the last by a constant
interval called the stride length. These can be a worst-case access
pattern for the standard memory-caching schemes when the stride length
is a multiple of the cache line size. Strided references are often
generated by loops through an array, and (if your data is large enough
that access-time is significant) it can be worthwhile to tune for better
locality by inverting double loops or by partially unrolling the outer
loop of a loop nest. This usage is borderline techspeak; the related
term memory stride is definitely techspeak.

`*hairy* <../H/hairy.html>`__ but is more positive in tone. Often in the
emphatic most studly or as noun-form studliness. “Smail 3.0's
configuration parser is most studly.”

SF story originally published in 1952 but much anthologized since, Mark
Clifton's *Star, Bright*. In it, a super-genius child classifies humans
into a very few ‘Brights’ like herself, a huge majority of ‘Stupids’,
and a minority of ‘Tweens’, the merely ordinary geniuses.

**Sturgeon's Law**: prov.

“Ninety percent of everything is crud”. Derived from a quote by science
fiction author Theodore Sturgeon, who once said, “Sure, 90% of science
fiction is crud. That's because 90% of everything is crud.” Sturgeon
himself called this “Sturgeon's Revelation”, and it first appeared in
the March 1958 issue of *Venture Science Fiction*; he gave Sturgeon's
Law as “Nothing is always absolutely so.” Oddly, when Sturgeon's
Revelation is cited, the final word is almost invariably changed to
‘crap’. Compare `*Hanlon's Razor* <../H/Hanlons-Razor.html>`__,
`*Ninety-Ninety Rule* <../N/Ninety-Ninety-Rule.html>`__. Though this
maxim originated in SF fandom, most hackers recognize it and are all too
aware of its truth.

**Sun**: n.

Sun Microsystems. Hackers remember that the name was originally an
acronym, Stanford University Network. Sun started out around 1980 with
some hardware hackers (mainly) from Stanford talking to some software
hackers (mainly) from UC Berkeley; Sun's original technology concept
married a clever board design based on the Motorola 68000 to
`*BSD* <../B/BSD.html>`__ Unix. Sun went on to lead the workstation
industry through the 1980s, and for years afterwards remained an
engineering-driven company and a good place for hackers to work. Though
Sun drifted away from its techie origins after 1990 and has since made
some strategic moves that disappointed and annoyed many hackers
(especially by maintaining proprietary control of Java and rejecting
Linux), it's still considered within the family in much the same way
`*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__ was in the 1970s and early 1980s.

**superprogrammer**: n.

A prolific programmer; one who can code exceedingly well and quickly.
Not all hackers are superprogrammers, but many are. (Productivity can
vary from one programmer to another by three orders of magnitude. For
example, one programmer might be able to write an average of 3 lines of
working code in one day, while another, with the proper tools, might be
able to write 3,000. This range is astonishing; it is matched in very
few other areas of human endeavor.) The term superprogrammer is more
commonly used within such places as IBM than in the hacker community. It
tends to stress naive measures of productivity and to underweight
creativity, ingenuity, and getting the job *done* — and to sidestep the
question of whether the 3,000 lines of code do more or less useful work
than three lines that do the `*Right Thing* <../R/Right-Thing.html>`__.
Hackers tend to prefer the terms `*hacker* <../H/hacker.html>`__ and
`*wizard* <../W/wizard.html>`__.

**super source quench**: n.

A special packet designed to shut up an Internet host. The Internet
Protocol (IP) has a control message called Source Quench that asks a
host to transmit more slowly on a particular connection to avoid
congestion. It also has a Redirect control message intended to instruct
a host to send certain packets to a different local router. A “super
source quench” is actually a redirect control packet, forged to look
like it came from a local router, that instructs a host to send all
packets to its own local loopback address. This will effectively tie
many Internet hosts up in knots. Compare

time a hacker calls support he or she will usually know the software and
the relevant manuals better than the support people (sadly, this is
*not* a joke or exaggeration). A hacker's idea of ‘support’ is a
*têete-à-têete* with the software's designer.

[from the ‘surf’ idiom for rapidly flipping TV channels] To traverse the

Hackers adopted this term early, but many have stopped using it since it
went completely mainstream around 1995. The passive, couch-potato
connotations that go with TV channel surfing were never pleasant, and
hearing non-hackers wax enthusiastic about “surfing the net” tends to
make hackers feel a bit as though their home is being overrun by
ignorami.

**swap**: vt.

1. [techspeak] To move information from a fast-access memory to a
slow-access memory (swap out), or vice versa (swap in). Often refers
specifically to the use of disks as virtual memory. As pieces of data or
program are needed, they are swapped into `*core* <../C/core.html>`__
for processing; when they are no longer needed they may be swapped out
again.

2. The jargon use of these terms analogizes people's short-term memories
with core. Cramming for an exam might be spoken of as swapping in. If
you temporarily forget someone's name, but then remember it, your excuse
is that it was swapped out. To keep something swapped in means to keep
it fresh in your memory: “I reread the TECO manual every few months to
keep it swapped in.” If someone interrupts you just as you got a good
idea, you might say “Wait a moment while I swap this out”, implying that
a piece of paper is your extra-somatic memory and that if you don't swap
the idea out by writing it down it will get overwritten and lost as you
talk. Compare `*page in* <../P/page-in.html>`__, `*page

**Swiss-Army chainsaw**

In early Unix days, a well-known technical paper analogized the lexical
analyzer generator lex(1) to a Swiss-army knife; this was a comment on
the remarkable variety of more general uses discovered for a program
originally designed as a special-purpose code generator for writing
compilers. Two decades later, well-known hacker Henry Spencer described
the `*Perl* <../P/Perl.html>`__ scripting language as a “Swiss-Army
chainsaw”, intending to convey his evaluation of the language as
exceedingly powerful but ugly and noisy and prone to belch noxious
fumes. This had two results: (1) Perl fans adopted the epithet as a
badge of pride, and (2) it entered more general usage to describe
software that is highly versatile but distressingly inelegant.

--------------

**swizzle**: v.

To convert external names, array indices, or references within a data
structure into address pointers when the data structure is brought into
main memory from external storage (also called pointer swizzling); this
may be done for speed in chasing references or to simplify code (e.g.,
by turning lots of name lookups into pointer dereferences). The converse
operation is sometimes termed unswizzling. See also
`*snap* <snap.html>`__.

(var.: synch)

1. To synchronize, to bring into synchronization.

2. [techspeak] To force all pending I/O to the disk; see
`*flush* <../F/flush.html>`__, sense 2.

3. More generally, to force a number of competing processes or agents to
a state that would be ‘safe’ if the system were to crash; thus, to
checkpoint (in the database-theory sense).

syntactic salt

--------------

**syntactic salt**: n.

The opposite of `*syntactic sugar* <syntactic-sugar.html>`__, a feature
designed to make it harder to write bad code. Specifically, syntactic
salt is a hoop the programmer must jump through just to prove that he
knows what's going on, rather than to express a program action. Some
programmers consider required type declarations to be syntactic salt. A
requirement to write **end if**, **end while**, **end do**, etc.: to
terminate the last block controlled by a control construct (as opposed
to just **end**) would definitely be syntactic salt. Syntactic salt is
like the real thing in that it tends to raise hackers' blood pressures
in an unhealthy way. Compare
`*candygrammar* <../C/candygrammar.html>`__.

syntactic sugar

`Prev <syntactic-salt.html>`__ 

S

 `Next <sys-frog.html>`__

--------------

**syntactic sugar**: n.

[coined by Peter Landin] Features added to a language or other formalism
to make it ‘sweeter’ for humans, but which do not affect the
expressiveness of the formalism (compare
`*chrome* <../C/chrome.html>`__). Used esp. when there is an obvious and
trivial translation of the ‘sugar’ feature into other constructs already
present in the notation. C's **a[i]** notation is syntactic sugar for
\*(a + i). “Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon.” — Alan
Perlis.

The variants syntactic saccharin and syntactic syrup are also recorded.
These denote something even more gratuitous, in that syntactic sugar
serves a purpose (making something more acceptable to humans), but
syntactic saccharin or syrup serve no purpose at all. Compare
`*candygrammar* <../C/candygrammar.html>`__, `*syntactic
salt* <syntactic-salt.html>`__.

international FidoNet board, thus sending it to hundreds of sysops
around the world.

Refers specifically to a systems programmer in charge of administration,
software maintenance, and updates at some site. Unlike
`*admin* <../A/admin.html>`__, this term emphasizes the technical end of
the skills involved.
