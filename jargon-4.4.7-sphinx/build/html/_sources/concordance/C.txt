**camelCase**

A variable in a programming language is sait to be camelCased when all
words but the first are capitalized. This practice contrasts with the C
tradition of either running syllables together or marking syllable
breaks with underscores; thus, where a C programmer would write
thisverylongname or this\_very\_long\_name, the camelCased version would
be thisVeryLongName. This practice is common in certain language
communities (formerly Pascal; today Java and Visual Basic) and tends to
be associated with object-oriented programming.

Compare `*BiCapitalization* <../B/BiCapitalization.html>`__; but where
that practice is primarily associated with marketing, camelCasing is not
aimed at impressing anybody, and hackers consider it respectable.

[Usenet] The archetype and model of all good

send out spam-cancels and then post notice anonymously to
``news.admin.policy``, ``news.admin.misc``, and
``alt.current-events.net-abuse``. The 'Moose stepped to the fore on its
own initiative, at a time (mid-1994) when spam-cancels were irregular
and disorganized, and behaved altogether admirably — fair, even-handed,
and quick to respond to comments and criticism, all without
self-aggrandizement or martyrdom. Cancelmoose[tm] quickly gained
near-unanimous support from the readership of all three above-mentioned
groups.

Nobody knows who Cancelmoose[tm] really is, and there aren't even any
good rumors. However, the 'Moose now has an e-mail address
(``<moose@cm.org>``) and a web site
(`http://www.cm.org/ <http://www.cm.org/>`__.) By early 1995, others had
stepped into the spam-cancel business, and appeared to be comporting
themselves well, after the 'Moose's manner. The 'Moose has now gotten
out of the business, and is more interested in ending spam (and cancels)
entirely.

candygrammar

`Prev <Cancelmoose.html>`__ 

C

 `Next <canonical.html>`__

--------------

**candygrammar**: n.

A programming-language grammar that is mostly `*syntactic
sugar* <../S/syntactic-sugar.html>`__; the term is also a play on
‘candygram’. `*COBOL* <COBOL.html>`__, Apple's Hypertalk language, and a
lot of the so-called ‘4GL’ database languages share this property. The
usual intent of such designs is that they be as English-like as
possible, on the theory that they will then be easier for unskilled
people to program. This intention comes to grief on the reality that
syntax isn't what makes programming hard; it's the mental effort and
organization required to specify an algorithm precisely that costs. Thus
the invariable result is that ‘candygrammar’ languages are just as
difficult to program in as terser ones, and far more painful for the
experienced hacker.

[The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live
should not be overlooked. This was a *Jaws* parody. Someone lurking
outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus ways to get the
occupant to open up, while ominous music plays in the background. The
last attempt is a half-hearted “Candygram!” When the door is opened, a
shark bursts in and chomps the poor occupant. [There is a similar gag in
“Blazing Saddles” —ESR] There is a moral here for those attracted to
candygrammars. Note that, in many circles, pretty much the same ones who
remember Monty Python sketches, all it takes is the word “Candygram!”,
suitably timed, to get people rolling on the floor. — GLS]

canonical

`Prev <candygrammar.html>`__ 

C

 `Next <careware.html>`__

--------------

**canonical**: adj.

[very common; historically, ‘according to religious law’] The usual or
standard state or manner of something. This word has a somewhat more
technical meaning in mathematics. Two formulas such as ``9 + x`` and
``x +    9`` are said to be equivalent because they mean the same thing,
but the second one is in canonical form because it is written in the
usual way, with the highest power of ``x`` first. Usually there are
fixed rules you can use to decide whether something is in canonical
form. The jargon meaning, a relaxation of the technical meaning,
acquired its present loading in computer-science culture largely through
its prominence in Alonzo Church's work in computation theory and
mathematical logic (see `*Knights of the Lambda
Calculus* <../K/Knights-of-the-Lambda-Calculus.html>`__). Compare
`*vanilla* <../V/vanilla.html>`__.

Non-technical academics do not use the adjective ‘canonical’ in any of
the senses defined above with any regularity; they do however use the
nouns canon and canonicity (not \*\*canonicalness or \*\*canonicality).
The canon of a given author is the complete body of authentic works by
that author (this usage is familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans as well as
to literary scholars). ‘\ *The* canon’ is the body of works in a given
field (e.g., works of literature, or of art, or of music) deemed
worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to investigate.

The word ‘canon’ has an interesting history. It derives ultimately from
the Greek *κανον* (akin to the English ‘cane’) referring to a reed.
Reeds were used for measurement, and in Latin and later Greek the word
‘canon’ meant a rule or a standard. The establishment of a canon of
scriptures within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a rule
for the religion. The above non-techspeak academic usages stem from this
instance of a defined and accepted body of work. Alongside this usage
was the promulgation of ‘canons’ (‘rules’) for the government of the
Catholic Church. The techspeak usages (“according to religious law”)
derive from this use of the Latin ‘canon’.

Hackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic
contrast with its historical meaning. A true story: One Bob Sjoberg, new
at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance at the incessant use of
jargon. Over his loud objections, GLS and RMS made a point of using as
much of it as possible in his presence, and eventually it began to sink
in. Finally, in one conversation, he used the word canonical in
jargon-like fashion without thinking. Steele: “Aha! We've finally got
you talking jargon too!” Stallman: “What did he say?” Steele: “Bob just
used ‘canonical’ in the canonical way.”

Of course, canonicality depends on context, but it is implicitly defined
as the way *hackers* normally expect things to be. Thus, a hacker may
claim with a straight face that ‘according to religious law’ is *not*
the canonical meaning of canonical.

--------------

**can't happen**

The traditional program comment for code executed under a condition that
should never be true, for example a file size computed as negative.
Often, such a condition being true indicates data corruption or a faulty
algorithm; it is almost always handled by emitting a fatal error message
and terminating or crashing, since there is little else that can be
done. Some case variant of “can't happen” is also often the text emitted
if the ‘impossible’ error actually happens! Although “can't happen”
events are genuinely infrequent in production code, programmers wise
enough to check for them habitually are often surprised at how
frequently they are triggered during development and how many headaches
checking for them turns out to head off. See also `*firewall
code* <../F/firewall-code.html>`__ (sense 2).

cargo cult programming

C

 `Next <cascade.html>`__

--------------

**cargo cult programming**: n.

A style of (incompetent) programming dominated by ritual inclusion of
code or program structures that serve no real purpose. A cargo cult
programmer will usually explain the extra code as a way of working
around some bug encountered in the past, but usually neither the bug nor
the reason the code apparently avoided the bug was ever fully understood
(compare `*shotgun debugging* <../S/shotgun-debugging.html>`__, `*voodoo
programming* <../V/voodoo-programming.html>`__).

The term ‘cargo cult’ is a reference to aboriginal religions that grew
up in the South Pacific after World War II. The practices of these cults
center on building elaborate mockups of airplanes and military style
landing strips in the hope of bringing the return of the god-like
airplanes that brought such marvelous cargo during the war. Hackish
usage probably derives from Richard Feynman's characterization of
certain practices as “cargo cult science” in his book *Surely You're
Joking, Mr. Feynman!* (W. W. Norton & Co, New York 1985, ISBN
0-393-01921-7).

2. A chain of Usenet followups, each adding some trivial variation or
riposte to the text of the previous one, all of which is reproduced in
the new message; an `*include war* <../I/include-war.html>`__ in which
the object is to create a sort of communal graffito.

[from ‘cut and paste’]

The addition of a new `*feature* <../F/feature.html>`__ to an existing
system by selecting the code from an existing feature and pasting it in
with minor changes. Common in telephony circles because most operations
in a telephone switch are selected using **case** statements. Leads to
`*software bloat* <../S/software-bloat.html>`__.

In some circles of EMACS users this is called ‘programming by Meta-W’,
because Meta-W is the EMACS command for copying a block of text to a
kill buffer in preparation to pasting it in elsewhere. The term is
condescending, implying that the programmer is acting mindlessly rather
than thinking carefully about what is required to integrate the code for
two similar cases.

clone-and-hack coding.

2. Nowadays, similar drastic surgery that's done just to make a machine

LEDs to give the machine an eerie interior glow like a B-movie flying
saucer. More advanced forms of case modding involve building machines
into weird and unlikely shapes. The effect can be quite artistic, but
one of the unwritten rules is that the machine must continue to function
as a computer.

Since he knew the design inside out, he could often find faults simply
by listening to a quick outline of the symptoms. He used to play on this
by going to some site where the field circus had just spent the last two
weeks solid trying to find a fault, and spreading a diagram of the
system out on a table top. He'd then shake some chicken bones and cast
them over the diagram, peer at the bones intently for a minute, and then
tell them that a certain module needed replacing. The system would start
working again immediately upon the replacement.

Rare outside Unix sites. See also `*dd* <../D/dd.html>`__,

Among Unix fans, cat(1) is considered an excellent example of
user-interface design, because it delivers the file contents without
such verbosity as spacing or headers between the files, and because it
does not require the files to consist of lines of text, but works with
any sort of data.

Among Unix haters, cat(1) is considered the
`*canonical* <canonical.html>`__ example of *bad* user-interface design,
because of its woefully unobvious name. It is far more often used to
`*blast* <../B/blast.html>`__ a file to standard output than to
concatenate two files. The name **cat** for the former operation is just
as unintuitive as, say, LISP's `*cdr* <cdr.html>`__.

**CDA**: /C·D·A/

The “Communications Decency Act”, passed as section 502 of a major
telecommunications reform bill on February 8th, 1996 (“Black Thursday”).
The CDA made it a federal crime in the USA to send a communication which
is “obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to
annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person.” It also threatened
with imprisonment anyone who “knowingly” makes accessible to minors any
message that “describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or
organs”.

While the CDA was sold as a measure to protect minors from the putative
evils of pornography, the repressive political aims of the bill were
laid bare by the Hyde amendment, which intended to outlaw discussion of
abortion on the Internet.

To say that this direct attack on First Amendment free-speech rights was
not well received on the Internet would be putting it mildly. A
firestorm of protest followed, including a February 29th 1996 mass
demonstration by thousands of netters who turned their `*home
page* <../H/home-page.html>`__\ s black for 48 hours. Several
civil-rights groups and computing/telecommunications companies mounted a
constitutional challenge. The CDA was demolished by a strongly-worded
decision handed down in 8th-circuit Federal court and subsequently
affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court on 26 June 1997 (“White Thursday”).

cdr

C

 `Next <chad.html>`__

--------------

**cdr**: /ku´dr/, /kuh´dr/, vt.

[from LISP] To skip past the first item from a list of things
(generalized from the LISP operation on binary tree structures, which
returns a list consisting of all but the first element of its argument).
In the form cdr down, to trace down a list of elements: “Shall we cdr
down the agenda?” Usage: silly. See also `*loop
through* <../L/loop-through.html>`__.

Historical note: The instruction format of the IBM 704 that hosted the
original LISP implementation featured two 15-bit fields called the
address and decrement parts. The term cdr was originally Contents of
Decrement part of Register. Similarly, car stood for Contents of Address
part of Register.

The cdr and car operations have since become bases for formation of
compound metaphors in non-LISP contexts. GLS recalls, for example, a
programming project in which strings were represented as linked lists;
the get-character and skip-character operations were of course called
CHAR and CHDR.

chad

--------------

**chad**: /chad/, n.

1. [common] The perforated edge strips on printer paper, after they have
been separated from the printed portion. Also called
`*selvage* <../S/selvage.html>`__, `*perf* <../P/perf.html>`__, and
`*ripoff* <../R/ripoff.html>`__.

2. The confetti-like paper bits punched out of cards or paper tape; this
has also been called chaff, computer confetti, and keypunch droppings.
It's reported that this was very old Army slang (associated with
teletypewriters before the computer era), and has been occasionally
sighted in directions for punched-card vote tabulators long after it
passed out of live use among computer programmers in the late 1970s.
This sense of ‘chad’ returned to the mainstream during the finale of the
hotly disputed U.S. presidential election in 2000 via stories about the
Florida vote recounts. Note however that in the revived mainstream usage
chad is not a mass noun and ‘a chad’ is a single piece of the stuff.

There is an urban legend that chad (sense 2) derives from the Chadless
keypunch (named for its inventor), which cut little u-shaped tabs in the
card to make a hole when the tab folded back, rather than punching out a
circle/rectangle; it was clear that if the Chadless keypunch didn't make
them, then the stuff that other keypunches made had to be ‘chad’.
However, serious attempts to track down “Chadless” as a personal name or
U.S. trademark have failed, casting doubt on this etymology — and the
U.S. Patent Classification System uses “chadless” (small c) as an
adjective, suggesting that “chadless” derives from “chad” and not the
other way around. There is another legend that the word was originally
acronymic, standing for “Card Hole Aggregate Debris”, but this has all
the earmarks of a `*backronym* <../B/backronym.html>`__. It has also
been noted that the word “chad” is Scots dialect for gravel, but nobody
has proposed any plausible reason that card chaff should be thought of
as gravel. None of these etymologies is really plausible.

**chain**

1. vi. [orig. from BASIC's **CHAIN** statement] To hand off execution to
a child or successor without going through the `*OS* <../O/OS.html>`__
command interpreter that invoked it. The state of the parent program is
lost and there is no returning to it. Though this facility used to be
common on memory-limited micros and is still widely supported for
backward compatibility, the jargon usage is semi-obsolescent; in
particular, most Unix programmers will think of this as an
`*exec* <../E/exec.html>`__. Oppose the more modern subshell.

2. n. A series of linked data areas within an operating system or
application. Chain rattling is the process of repeatedly running through
the linked data areas searching for one which is of interest to the
executing program. The implication is that there is a very large number
of links on the chain.

--------------

**chainik**: /chi:´nik/

[Russian, literally “teapot”] Almost synonymous with
`*muggle* <../M/muggle.html>`__. Implies both ignorance and a certain
amount of willingness to learn, but does not necessarily imply as little
experience or short exposure time as `*newbie* <../N/newbie.html>`__ and
is not as derogatory as `*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__. Both a novice
user and someone using a system for a long time without any
understanding of the internals can be referred to as chainiks. Very
widespread term in Russian hackish, often used in an English context by
Russian-speaking hackers esp. in Israel (e.g. “Our new colleague is a
complete chainik”). FidoNet discussion groups often had a “chainik”
subsection for newbies and, well, old chainiks (eg. su.asm.chainik,
ru.linux.chainik, ru.html.chainik). Public projects often have a chainik
mailing list to keep the chainiks off the developers' and experienced
users' discussions. Today, the word is slowly slipping into mainstream
Russian due to the Russian translation of the popular yellow-black
covered “foobar for dummies” series, which (correctly) uses “chainik”
for “dummy”, but its frequent (though not excessive) use is still
characteristic hacker-speak.

can have topic descriptions (which are generally irrelevant to the
actual subject of discussion). Some notable channels are **#initgame**,
**#hottub**, **callahans**, and **#report**. At times of international
crisis, **#report** has hundreds of members, some of whom take turns
listening to various news services and typing in summaries of the news,
or in some cases, giving first-hand accounts of the action (e.g., Scud
missile attacks in Tel Aviv during the Gulf War in 1991).

**chawmp**: n.

[University of Florida] 16 or 18 bits (half of a machine word). This
term was used by FORTH hackers during the late 1970s/early 1980s; it is
said to have been archaic then, and may now be obsolete. It was coined
in revolt against the promiscuous use of ‘word’ for anything between 16
and 32 bits; ‘word’ has an additional special meaning for FORTH hacks
that made the overloading intolerable. For similar reasons, /gaw´bl/
(spelled ‘gawble’ or possibly ‘gawbul’) was in use as a term for 32 or
48 bits (presumably a full machine word, but our sources are unclear on
this). These terms are more easily understood if one thinks of them as
faithful phonetic spellings of ‘chomp’ and ‘gobble’ pronounced in a
Florida or other Southern U.S. dialect. For general discussion of
similar terms, see `*nybble* <../N/nybble.html>`__.

**choad**: /chohd/, n.

Synonym for ‘penis’ used in ``alt.tasteless`` and popularized by the
denizens thereof. They say: “We think maybe it's from Middle English but
we're all too damned lazy to check the OED.” [I'm not. It isn't. —ESR]
This term is alleged to have been inherited through 1960s underground
comics, and to have been recently sighted in the Beavis and Butthead
cartoons. Speakers of the Hindi, Bengali and Gujarati languages have
confirmed that ‘choad’ is in fact an Indian vernacular word equivalent
to ‘fuck’; it is therefore likely to have entered English slang via the
British Raj.

--------------

**chomp**: vi.

1. To `*lose* <../L/lose.html>`__; specifically, to chew on something of
which more was bitten off than one can. Probably related to gnashing of
teeth.

2. To bite the bag; See `*bagbiter* <../B/bagbiter.html>`__.

A hand gesture commonly accompanies this. To perform it, hold the four
fingers together and place the thumb against their tips. Now open and
close your hand rapidly to suggest a biting action (much like what
Pac-Man does in the classic video game, though this pantomime seems to
predate that). The gesture alone means ‘chomp chomp’ (see `Verb
Doubling <../verb-doubling.html>`__ in the `Jargon
Construction <../construction.html>`__ section of the Prependices). The
hand may be pointed at the object of complaint, and for real emphasis
you can use both hands at once. Doing this to a person is equivalent to
saying “You chomper!” If you point the gesture at yourself, it is a
humble but humorous admission of some failure. You might do this if
someone told you that a program you had written had failed in some
surprising way and you felt dumb for not having anticipated it.

3. The name of a programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie during
the early 1970s and immediately used to reimplement
`*Unix* <../U/Unix.html>`__; so called because many features derived
from an earlier compiler named ‘B’ in commemoration of *its* parent,
BCPL. (BCPL was in turn descended from an earlier Algol-derived
language, CPL.) Before Bjarne Stroustrup settled the question by
designing `*C++* <C-plus-plus.html>`__, there was a humorous debate over
whether C's successor should be named ‘D’ or ‘P’. C became immensely
popular outside Bell Labs after about 1980 and is now the dominant
language in systems and microcomputer applications programming. C is
often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain varying
according to the speaker, as “a language that combines all the elegance
and power of assembly language with all the readability and
maintainability of assembly language” See also `*languages of

= PC (referring to IBM's ISA-bus machines as opposed to the PS/2
series). This construction is especially used of product series in which
the newer versions are considered serious losers relative to the older

click of death

`Prev <clean.html>`__ 

C

 `Next <CLM.html>`__

--------------

**click of death**: n.

A syndrome of certain Iomega ZIP drives, named for the clicking noise
that is caused by the malady. An affected drive will, after accepting a
disk, will start making a clicking noise and refuse to eject the disk. A
common solution for retrieving the disk is to insert the bent end of a
paper clip into a small hole adjacent to the slot. “Clicked” disks are
generally unusable after being retrieved from the drive.

The clicking noise is caused by the drive's read/write head bumping
against its movement stops when it fails to find track 0 on the disk,
causing the head to become misaligned. This can happen when the drive
has been subjected to a physical shock, or when the disk is exposed to
an electromagnetic field, such as that of the CRT. Another common cause
is when a package of disks is armed with an anti-theft strip at a store.
When the clerk scans the product to disarm the strip, it can demagnetize
the disks, wiping out track 0.

There is evidence that the click of death is a communicable disease; a
“clicked” disk can cause the read/write head of a "clean" drive to
become misaligned. Iomega at first denied the existence of the click of
death, but eventually offered to replace free of charge any drives
affected by the condition.

Reported from Sweden, a (hypothetical) disease one might get from coding
in COBOL. The language requires code verbose beyond all reason (see
`*candygrammar* <candygrammar.html>`__); thus it is alleged that
programming too much in COBOL causes one's fingers to wear down to stubs
by the endless typing. “I refuse to type in all that source code again;
it would give me COBOL fingers!”

underplumage consisting of button-down shirt (starch optional) and a
tie. In times of dire stress, the sleeves (if long) may be rolled up and
the tie loosened about half an inch. It seldom helps. The `*code

**code**

1. n. The stuff that software writers write, either in source form or
after translation by a compiler or assembler. Often used in opposition
to “data”, which is the stuff that code operates on. Among hackers this
is a mass noun, as in “How much code does it take to do a `*bubble
sort* <../B/bubble-sort.html>`__?”, or “The code is loaded at the high
end of RAM.” Among scientific programmers it is sometimes a count noun
equilvalent to “program”; thus they may speak of “codes” in the plural.
Anyone referring to software as “the software codes” is probably a
`*newbie* <../N/newbie.html>`__ or a `*suit* <../S/suit.html>`__.

2. v. To write code. In this sense, always refers to source code rather
than compiled. “I coded an Emacs clone in two hours!” This verb is a bit
of a cultural marker associated with the Unix and minicomputer
traditions (and lately Linux); people within that culture prefer v.
‘code’ to v. ‘program’ whereas outside it the reverse is normally true.

**coefficient of X**: n.

Hackish speech makes heavy use of pseudo-mathematical metaphors. Four
particularly important ones involve the terms coefficient, factor, index
of X, and quotient. They are often loosely applied to things you cannot
really be quantitative about, but there are subtle distinctions among
them that convey information about the way the speaker mentally models
whatever he or she is describing. Foo factor and foo quotient tend to
describe something for which the issue is one of presence or absence.
The canonical example is `*fudge factor* <../F/fudge-factor.html>`__.
It's not important how much you're fudging; the term simply acknowledges
that some fudging is needed. You might talk of liking a movie for its
silliness factor. Quotient tends to imply that the property is a ratio
of two opposing factors: “I would have won except for my luck quotient.”
This could also be “I would have won except for the luck factor”, but
using *quotient* emphasizes that it was bad luck overpowering good luck
(or someone else's good luck overpowering your own). Foo index and
coefficient of foo both tend to imply that foo is, if not strictly
measurable, at least something that can be larger or smaller. Thus, you
might refer to a paper or person as having a high bogosity index,
whereas you would be less likely to speak of a high bogosity factor. Foo
index suggests that foo is a condensation of many quantities, as in the
mundane cost-of-living index; coefficient of foo suggests that foo is a
fundamental quantity, as in a coefficient of friction. The choice
between these terms is often one of personal preference; e.g., some
people might feel that bogosity is a fundamental attribute and thus say
coefficient of bogosity, whereas others might feel it is a combination
of factors and thus say bogosity index.

**cokebottle**: /kohk´bot·l/, n.

Any very unusual character, particularly one you can't type because it
isn't on your keyboard. MIT people used to complain about the
‘control-meta-cokebottle’ commands at SAIL, and SAIL people complained
right back about the ‘escape-escape-cokebottle’ commands at MIT. After
the demise of the `*space-cadet
keyboard* <../S/space-cadet-keyboard.html>`__, cokebottle faded away as
serious usage, but was often invoked humorously to describe an
(unspecified) weird or non-intuitive keystroke command. It may be due
for a second inning, however. The OSF/Motif window manager, mwm(1), has
a reserved keystroke for switching to the default set of keybindings and
behavior. This keystroke is (believe it or not) ‘control-meta-bang’ (see
`*bang* <../B/bang.html>`__). Since the exclamation point looks a lot
like an upside down Coke bottle, Motif hackers have begun referring to
this keystroke as cokebottle. See also `*quadruple

COME FROM

`Prev <cold-boot.html>`__ 

C

 `Next <comm-mode.html>`__

--------------

**COME FROM**: n.

A semi-mythical language construct dual to the ‘go to’; **COME FROM**
<label> would cause the referenced label to act as a sort of trapdoor,
so that if the program ever reached it control would quietly and
`*automagically* <../A/automagically.html>`__ be transferred to the
statement following the **COME FROM**. **COME FROM** was first proposed
in R. Lawrence Clark's *A Linguistic Contribution to GOTO-less
programming*, which appeared in a 1973
`*Datamation* <../D/Datamation.html>`__ issue (and was reprinted in the
April 1984 issue of *Communications of the ACM*). This parodied the
then-raging ‘structured programming’ `*holy
wars* <../H/holy-wars.html>`__ (see `*considered
harmful* <considered-harmful.html>`__). Mythically, some variants are
the assigned COME FROM and the computed COME FROM (parodying some nasty
control constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs). Of course,
multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be implemented by having more
than one **COME FROM** statement coming from the same label.

In some ways the FORTRAN **DO** looks like a **COME FROM** statement.
After the terminating statement number/\ **CONTINUE** is reached,
control continues at the statement following the DO. Some generous
FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements (other than **CONTINUE**) for
the statement, leading to examples like:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .. code:: programlisting                                                 |

|           DO 10 I=1,LIMIT                                                |
|     C imagine many lines of code here, leaving the                       |
|     C original DO statement lost in the spaghetti...                     |
|           WRITE(6,10) I,FROB(I)                                          |
|      10   FORMAT(1X,I5,G10.4)                                            |
                                                                          
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

in which the trapdoor is just after the statement labeled 10. (This is
particularly surprising because the label doesn't appear to have
anything to do with the flow of control at all!) While sufficiently
astonishing to the unsuspecting reader, this form of **COME FROM**
statement isn't completely general. After all, control will eventually
pass to the following statement. The implementation of the general form
was left to Univac FORTRAN, ca. 1975 (though a roughly similar feature
existed on the IBM 7040 ten years earlier). The statement **AT 100**
would perform a **COME FROM 100**. It was intended strictly as a
debugging aid, with dire consequences promised to anyone so deranged as
to use it in production code. More horrible things had already been
perpetrated in production languages, however; doubters need only
contemplate the **ALTER** verb in `*COBOL* <COBOL.html>`__. **COME
FROM** was supported under its own name for the first time 15 years
later, in C-INTERCAL (see `*INTERCAL* <../I/INTERCAL.html>`__,
`*retrocomputing* <../R/retrocomputing.html>`__); knowledgeable
observers are still reeling from the shock.

**Commonwealth Hackish**: n.

Hacker jargon as spoken in English outside the U.S., esp. in the British
Commonwealth. It is reported that Commonwealth speakers are more likely
to pronounce truncations like ‘char’ and ‘soc’, etc., as spelled
(/char/, /sok/), as opposed to American /keir/ and /sohsh/. Dots in
`*newsgroup* <../N/newsgroup.html>`__ names (especially two-component
names) tend to be pronounced more often (so soc.wibble is /sok dot
wib´l/ rather than /sohsh wib´l/).

Preferred `*metasyntactic
variable* <../M/metasyntactic-variable.html>`__\ s include
`*blurgle* <../B/blurgle.html>`__, **eek**, **ook**, **frodo**, and
**bilbo**; `*wibble* <../W/wibble.html>`__, **wobble**, and in
emergencies **wubble**; **flob**, **banana**, **tom**, **dick**,
**harry**, **wombat**, **frog**, `*fish* <../F/fish.html>`__,
`*womble* <../W/womble.html>`__ and so on and on (see
`*foo* <../F/foo.html>`__, sense 4). Alternatives to verb doubling
include suffixes -o-rama, frenzy (as in feeding frenzy), and city
(examples: “barf city!” “hack-o-rama!” “core dump frenzy!”).

All the generic differences within the anglophone world inevitably show
themselves in the associated hackish dialects. The Greek letters beta
and zeta are usually pronounced /bee´t@/ and /zee´t@/; meta may also be
pronounced /mee´t@/. Various punctuators (and even letters - Z is called
‘zed’, not ‘zee’) are named differently: most crucially, for hackish,
where Americans use ‘parens’, ‘brackets’ and \`braces' for (), [] and
{}, Commonwealth English uses ‘brackets’, ‘square brackets’ and ‘curly
brackets’, though ‘parentheses’ may be used for the first; the
exclamation mark, ‘!’, is called pling rather than bang and the pound
sign, ‘#’, is called hash; furthermore, the term ‘the pound sign’ is
understood to mean the £ (of course). Canadian hacker slang, as with
mainstream language, mixes American and British usages about evenly.

**compact**: adj.

Of a design, describes the valuable property that it can all be
apprehended at once in one's head. This generally means the thing
created from the design can be used with greater facility and fewer
errors than an equivalent tool that is not compact. Compactness does not
imply triviality or lack of power; for example, C is compact and FORTRAN
is not, but C is more powerful than FORTRAN. Designs become non-compact
through accreting `*feature* <../F/feature.html>`__\ s and
`*cruft* <cruft.html>`__ that don't merge cleanly into the overall
design scheme (thus, some fans of `*Classic C* <Classic-C.html>`__
maintain that ANSI C is no longer compact).

**computer confetti**: n.

Syn. `*chad* <chad.html>`__. [obs.] Though this term was common at one
time, this use of punched-card chad is not a good idea, as the pieces
are stiff and have sharp corners that could injure the eyes. GLS reports
that he once attended a wedding at MIT during which he and a few other
guests enthusiastically threw chad instead of rice. The groom later
grumbled that he and his bride had spent most of the evening trying to
get the stuff out of their hair.

[2001 update: this term has passed out of use for two reasons; (1) the
stuff it describes is now quite rare, and (2) the term
`*chad* <chad.html>`__, which was half-forgotten in 1990, has enjoyed a
revival. —ESR]

computron

`Prev <computer-confetti.html>`__ 

C

 `Next <con_.html>`__

--------------

**computron**: /kom´pyoo·tron\`/, n.

1. [common] A notional unit of computing power combining instruction
speed and storage capacity, dimensioned roughly in
instructions-per-second times megabytes-of-main-store times
megabytes-of-mass-storage. “That machine can't run GNU Emacs, it doesn't
have enough computrons!” This usage is usually found in metaphors that
treat computing power as a fungible commodity good, like a crop yield or
diesel horsepower. See `*bitty box* <../B/bitty-box.html>`__, `*Get a
real computer!* <../G/Get-a-real-computer-.html>`__,
`*toy* <../T/toy.html>`__, `*crank* <crank.html>`__.

2. A mythical subatomic particle that bears the unit quantity of
computation or information, in much the same way that an electron bears
one unit of electric charge (see also `*bogon* <../B/bogon.html>`__). An
elaborate pseudo-scientific theory of computrons has been developed
based on the physical fact that the molecules in a solid object move
more rapidly as it is heated. It is argued that an object melts because
the molecules have lost their information about where they are supposed
to be (that is, they have emitted computrons). This explains why
computers get so hot and require air conditioning; they use up
computrons. Conversely, it should be possible to cool down an object by
placing it in the path of a computron beam. It is believed that this may
also explain why machines that work at the factory fail in the computer
room: the computrons there have been all used up by the other hardware.
(The popularity of this theory probably owes something to the *Warlock*
stories by Larry Niven, the best known being *What Good is a Glass
Dagger?*, in which magic is fueled by an exhaustible natural resource
called *mana*.)

**connector conspiracy**: n.

[probably came into prominence with the appearance of the KL-10 (one
model of the `*PDP-10* <../P/PDP-10.html>`__), none of whose connectors
matched anything else] The tendency of manufacturers (or, by extension,
programmers or purveyors of anything) to come up with new products that
don't fit together with the old stuff, thereby making you buy either all
new stuff or expensive interface devices.

(A closely related phenomenon, with a slightly different intent, is the
habit manufacturers have of inventing new screw heads so that only
Designated Persons, possessing the magic screwdrivers, can remove covers
and make repairs or install options. A good 1990s example is the use of
Torx screws for cable-TV set-top boxes. Older Apple Macintoshes took
this one step further, requiring not only a long Torx screwdriver but a
specialized case-cracking tool to open the box.)

In these latter days of open-systems computing this term has fallen
somewhat into disuse, to be replaced by the observation that “Standards
are great! There are so many of them to choose from!” Compare `*backward

**cons**: /konz/, /kons/

[from LISP]

1. vt. To add a new element to a specified list, esp. at the top. “OK,
cons picking a replacement for the console TTY onto the agenda.”

2. cons up: vt. To synthesize from smaller pieces: “to cons up an
example”.

In LISP itself, **cons** is the most fundamental operation for building
structures. It takes any two objects and returns a dot-pair or
two-branched tree with one object hanging from each branch. Because the
result of a cons is an object, it can be used to build binary trees of
any shape and complexity. Hackers think of it as a sort of universal
constructor, and that is where the jargon meanings spring from.

**considered harmful**: adj.

[very common] Edsger W. Dijkstra's note in the March 1968
*Communications of the ACM*, *Goto Statement Considered Harmful*, fired
the first salvo in the structured programming wars (text at
`http://www.acm.org/classics/ <http://www.acm.org/classics/>`__). As it
`turns out <http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26585.html>`__, the
title under which the letter appeared was actually supplied by CACM's
editor, Niklaus Wirth. Amusingly, the ACM considered the resulting
acrimony sufficiently harmful that it will (by policy) no longer print
an article taking so assertive a position against a coding practice.
(Years afterwards, a contrary view was uttered in a CACM letter called,
inevitably, *‘Goto considered harmful’ considered harmful'*'. In the
ensuing decades, a large number of both serious papers and parodies have
borne titles of the form *X considered Y*. The structured-programming
wars eventually blew over with the realization that both sides were
wrong, but use of such titles has remained as a persistent minor in-joke
(the ‘considered silly’ found at various places in this lexicon is
related).

sysadmins to post urgent messages to all users from the console (on

2. On microcomputer Unix boxes, the main screen and keyboard (as opposed
to character-only terminals talking to a serial port). Typically only
the console can do real graphics or run `*X* <../X/X.html>`__.

continue when you're ready to listen to him — as opposed to control-O,
which has more of the meaning of “Shut up.” Considered silly.

Conway's Law

`Prev <control-S.html>`__ 

C

--------------

**Conway's Law**: prov.

The rule that the organization of the software and the organization of
the software team will be congruent; commonly stated as “If you have
four groups working on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass compiler”. The
original statement was more general, “Organizations which design systems
are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication
structures of these organizations.” This first appeared in the April
1968 issue of `*Datamation* <../D/Datamation.html>`__. Compare `*SNAFU
principle* <../S/SNAFU-principle.html>`__.

The law was named after Melvin Conway, an early proto-hacker who wrote
an assembler for the Burroughs 220 called SAVE. (The name ‘SAVE’ didn't
stand for anything; it was just that you lost fewer card decks and
listings because they all had SAVE written on them.) There is also Tom
Cheatham's amendment of Conway's Law: “If a group of N persons
implements a COBOL compiler, there will be N-1 passes. Someone in the
group has to be the manager.”

cooked mode may refer to any mode of a system that does extensive
preprocessing before presenting data to a program.

hip (by the standards of the day) TV variety show. One of the best parts
of the show was the recurring ‘cookie bear’ sketch. In these sketches, a
guy in a bear suit tried all sorts of tricks to get a cookie out of
Williams. The sketches would always end with Williams shrieking (and I
don't mean figuratively), ‘No cookies! Not now, not ever...NEVER!!!’ And
the bear would fall down. Great stuff.”

legends (implying they probably never existed) but they existed, all

Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and Doug McIlroy in the early 1960s

not involved). Their original game was called ‘Darwin’ and ran on a IBM

**cosmic rays**: n.

Notionally, the cause of `*bit rot* <../B/bit-rot.html>`__. However,
this is a semi-independent usage that may be invoked as a humorous way
to `*handwave* <../H/handwave.html>`__ away any minor
`*randomness* <../R/randomness.html>`__ that doesn't seem worth the
bother of investigating. “Hey, Eric — I just got a burst of garbage on
my `*tube* <../T/tube.html>`__, where did that come from?” “Cosmic rays,
I guess.” Compare `*sunspots* <../S/sunspots.html>`__, `*phase of the
moon* <../P/phase-of-the-moon.html>`__. The British seem to prefer the
usage cosmic showers; alpha particles is also heard, because stray alpha
particles passing through a memory chip can cause single-bit errors
(this becomes increasingly more likely as memory sizes and densities
increase).

Factual note: Alpha particles cause bit rot, cosmic rays do not (except
occasionally in spaceborne computers). Intel could not explain random
bit drops in their early chips, and one hypothesis was cosmic rays. So
they created the World's Largest Lead Safe, using 25 tons of the stuff,
and used two identical boards for testing. One was placed in the safe,
one outside. The hypothesis was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit
drops, they should see a statistically significant difference between
the error rates on the two boards. They did not observe such a
difference. Further investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit
drops were due to alpha particle emissions from thorium (and to a much
lesser degree uranium) in the encapsulation material. Since it is
impossible to eliminate these radioactives (they are uniformly
distributed through the earth's crust, with the statistically
insignificant exception of uranium lodes) it became obvious that one has
to design memories to withstand these hits.

Much of the `*cruft* <cruft.html>`__ results from C++'s attempt to be
backward compatible with C. Stroustrup himself has said in his
retrospective book *The Design and Evolution of C++* (p. 207), “Within

**C Programmer's Disease**: n.

The tendency of the undisciplined C programmer to set arbitrary but
supposedly generous static limits on table sizes (defined, if you're
lucky, by constants in header files) rather than taking the trouble to
do proper dynamic storage allocation. If an application user later needs
to put 68 elements into a table of size 50, the afflicted programmer
reasons that he or she can easily reset the table size to 68 (or even as
much as 70, to allow for future expansion) and recompile. This gives the
programmer the comfortable feeling of having made the effort to satisfy
the user's (unreasonable) demands, and often affords the user multiple
opportunities to explore the marvelous consequences of `*fandango on
core* <../F/fandango-on-core.html>`__. In severe cases of the disease,
the programmer cannot comprehend why each fix of this kind seems only to
further disgruntle the user.

**CPU Wars**: /C·P·U worz/, n.

A 1979 large-format comic by Chas Andres chronicling the attempts of the
brainwashed androids of IPM (Impossible to Program Machines) to conquer
and destroy the peaceful denizens of HEC (Human Engineered Computers).
This rather transparent allegory featured many references to
`*ADVENT* <../A/ADVENT.html>`__ and the immortal line “Eat flaming
death, minicomputer mongrels!” (uttered, of course, by an IPM
stormtrooper). The whole shebang is now `available on the
Web <http://www.e-pix.com/CPUWARS/cpuwars.html>`__.

It is alleged that the author subsequently received a letter of
appreciation on IBM company stationery from the head of IBM's Thomas J.
Watson Research Laboratories (at that time one of the few islands of
true hackerdom in the IBM archipelago). The lower loop of the B in the
IBM logo, it is said, had been carefully whited out. See `*eat flaming

cracker

--------------

**cracker**: n.

One who breaks security on a system. Coined ca. 1985 by hackers in
defense against journalistic misuse of `*hacker* <../H/hacker.html>`__
(q.v., sense 8). An earlier attempt to establish worm in this sense
around 1981--82 on Usenet was largely a failure.

Use of both these neologisms reflects a strong revulsion against the
theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings. The neologism
“cracker” in this sense may have been influenced not so much by the term
“safe-cracker” as by the non-jargon term “cracker”, which in Middle
English meant an obnoxious person (e.g., “What cracker is this same that
deafs our ears / With this abundance of superfluous breath?” —
Shakespeare's King John, Act II, Scene I) and in modern colloquial
American English survives as a barely gentler synonym for “white trash”.

While it is expected that any real hacker will have done some playful
cracking and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone past `*larval
stage* <../L/larval-stage.html>`__ is expected to have outgrown the
desire to do so except for immediate, benign, practical reasons (for
example, if it's necessary to get around some security in order to get
some work done).

Thus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom than
the `*mundane* <../M/mundane.html>`__ reader misled by sensationalistic
journalism might expect. Crackers tend to gather in small, tight-knit,
very secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge, open
poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to
describe *themselves* as hackers, most true hackers consider them a
separate and lower form of life. An easy way for outsiders to spot the
difference is that crackers use grandiose screen names that conceal
their identities. Hackers never do this; they only rarely use *noms de
guerre* at all, and when they do it is for display rather than
concealment.

Ethical considerations aside, hackers figure that anyone who can't
imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers than
breaking into someone else's has to be pretty
`*losing* <../L/losing.html>`__. Some other reasons crackers are looked
down on are discussed in the entries on `*cracking* <cracking.html>`__
and `*phreaking* <../P/phreaking.html>`__. See also
`*samurai* <../S/samurai.html>`__, `*dark-side

**crawling horror**: n.

Ancient crufty hardware or software that is kept obstinately alive by
forces beyond the control of the hackers at a site. Like `*dusty
deck* <../D/dusty-deck.html>`__ or
`*gonkulator* <../G/gonkulator.html>`__, but connotes that the thing
described is not just an irritation but an active menace to health and
sanity. “Mostly we code new stuff in C, but they pay us to maintain one
big FORTRAN II application from nineteen-sixty-X that's a real crawling
horror....” Compare `*WOMBAT* <../W/WOMBAT.html>`__.

This usage is almost certainly derived from the fiction of H.P.
Lovecraft. Lovecraft may never have used the exact phrase “crawling
horror” in his writings, but one of the fearsome Elder Gods that he
wrote extensively about was Nyarlethotep, who had as an epithet “The
Crawling Chaos”. Certainly the extreme, even melodramatic horror of his
characters at the weird monsters they encounter, even to the point of
going insane with fear, is what hackers are referring to with this
phrase when they use it for horribly bad code. Compare
`*cthulhic* <cthulhic.html>`__.

**CRC handbook**

Any of the editions of the *Chemical Rubber Company Handbook of
Chemistry and Physics*; there are other CRC handbooks, such as the *CRC
Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae*, but “the” CRC handbook is
the chemistry and physics reference. It is massive tome full of
mathematical tables, physical constants of thousands of alloys and
chemical compounds, dielectric strengths, vapor pressure, resistivity,
and the like. Hackers have remarkably little actual use for these sorts
of arcana, but are such information junkies that a large percentage of
them acquire copies anyway and would feel vaguely bereft if they
couldn't look up the magnetic susceptibility of potassium permanganate
at a moment's notice. On hackers' bookshelves, the CRC handbook is
rather likely to keep company with an unabridged Oxford English
Dictionary and a good atlas.

The (false) belief that large, innovative software designs can be

In fact, experience has shown repeatedly that good designs arise only
from evolutionary, exploratory interaction between one (or at most a
small handful of) exceptionally able designer(s) and an active user
population — and that the first try at a big new idea is always wrong.

**creeping elegance**: n.

Describes a tendency for parts of a design to become
`*elegant* <../E/elegant.html>`__ past the point of diminishing return,
something which often happens at the expense of the less interesting
parts of the design, the schedule, and other things deemed important in
the `*Real World* <../R/Real-World.html>`__. See also `*creeping

--------------

**creeping featurism**: /kree´ping fee´chr·izm/, n.

[common]

1. Describes a systematic tendency to load more
`*chrome* <chrome.html>`__ and `*feature* <../F/feature.html>`__\ s onto
systems at the expense of whatever elegance they may have possessed when
originally designed. See also `*feeping
creaturism* <../F/feeping-creaturism.html>`__. “You know, the main
problem with `*BSD* <../B/BSD.html>`__ Unix has always been creeping
featurism.”

2. More generally, the tendency for anything complicated to become even
more complicated because people keep saying “Gee, it would be even
better if it had this feature too”. (See
`*feature* <../F/feature.html>`__.) The result is usually a patchwork
because it grew one ad-hoc step at a time, rather than being planned.
Planning is a lot of work, but it's easy to add just one extra little
feature to help someone ... and then another ... and another.... When
creeping featurism gets out of hand, it's like a cancer. The GNU hello
program, intended to illustrate `*GNU* <../G/GNU.html>`__ command-line
switch and coding conventions, is also a wonderful parody of creeping
featurism; the distribution changelog is particularly funny. Usually
this term is used to describe computer programs, but it could also be
said of the federal government, the IRS 1040 form, and new cars. A
similar phenomenon sometimes afflicts conscious redesigns; see
`*second-system effect* <../S/second-system-effect.html>`__. See also
`*creeping elegance* <creeping-elegance.html>`__.

--------------

**crippleware**: n.

1. [common] Software that has some important functionality deliberately
removed, so as to entice potential users to pay for a working version.

2. [Cambridge] Variety of `*guiltware* <../G/guiltware.html>`__ that
exhorts you to donate to some charity (compare
`*careware* <careware.html>`__, `*nagware* <../N/nagware.html>`__).

3. Hardware deliberately crippled, which can be upgraded to a more
expensive model by a trivial change (e.g., cutting a jumper).

An excellent example of crippleware (sense 3) is Intel's 486SX chip,
which is a standard 486DX chip with the co-processor diked out (in some
early versions it was present but disabled). To upgrade, you buy a
complete 486DX chip with *working* co-processor (its identity thinly
veiled by a different pinout) and plug it into the board's expansion
socket. It then disables the SX, which becomes a fancy power sink. Don't
you love Intel?

In physics, the minimum amount of fissionable material required to
sustain a chain reaction. Of a software product, describes a condition
of the software such that fixing one bug introduces one plus

`*creeping featurism* <creeping-featurism.html>`__, ports to too many
disparate environments, poor initial design, etc.) When software
achieves critical mass, it can never be fixed; it can only be discarded
and rewritten.

crock

`Prev <crlf.html>`__ 

C

 `Next <cross-post.html>`__

--------------

**crock**: n.

[from the American scatologism crock of shit]

1. An awkward feature or programming technique that ought to be made
cleaner. For example, using small integers to represent error codes
without the program interpreting them to the user (as in, for example,
Unix make(1), which returns code 139 for a process that dies due to
`*segfault* <../S/segfault.html>`__).

2. A technique that works acceptably, but which is quite prone to
failure if disturbed in the least. For example, a too-clever programmer
might write an assembler which mapped instruction mnemonics to numeric
opcodes algorithmically, a trick which depends far too intimately on the
particular bit patterns of the opcodes. (For another example of
programming with a dependence on actual opcode values, see `The Story of
Mel' <../story-of-mel.html>`__ in Appendix A.) Many crocks have a
tightly woven, almost completely unmodifiable structure. See
`*kluge* <../K/kluge.html>`__, `*brittle* <../B/brittle.html>`__. The
adjectives crockish and crocky, and the nouns crockishness and
crockitude, are also used.

crufty

C

 `Next <crumb.html>`__

--------------

**crufty**: /kruhf´tee/, adj.

[very common; origin unknown; poss. from ‘crusty’ or ‘cruddy’]

1. Poorly built, possibly over-complex. The
`*canonical* <canonical.html>`__ example is “This is standard old crufty
`*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__ software”. In fact, one fanciful theory of the
origin of crufty holds that was originally a mutation of ‘crusty’
applied to DEC software so old that the ‘s’ characters were tall and
skinny, looking more like ‘f’ characters.

2. Unpleasant, especially to the touch, often with encrusted junk. Like
spilled coffee smeared with peanut butter and catsup.

3. Generally unpleasant.

4. (sometimes spelled cruftie) n. A small crufty object (see
`*frob* <../F/frob.html>`__); often one that doesn't fit well into the
scheme of things. “A LISP property list is a good place to store
crufties (or, collectively, `*random* <../R/random.html>`__ cruft).”

This term is one of the oldest in the jargon and no one is sure of its
etymology, but it is suggestive that there is a Cruft Hall at Harvard
University which is part of the old physics building; it's said to have
been the physics department's radar lab during WWII. To this day (early
1993) the windows appear to be full of random techno-junk. MIT or
Lincoln Labs people may well have coined the term as a knock on the
competition.

C

--------------

**crunch**

1. vi. To process, usually in a time-consuming or complicated way.
Connotes an essentially trivial operation that is nonetheless painful to
perform. The pain may be due to the triviality's being embedded in a
loop from 1 to 1,000,000,000. “FORTRAN programs do mostly
`*number-crunching* <../N/number-crunching.html>`__.”

2. vt. To reduce the size of a file by a complicated scheme that
produces bit configurations completely unrelated to the original data,
such as by a Huffman code. (The file ends up looking something like a
paper document would if somebody crunched the paper into a wad.) Since
such compression usually takes more computations than simpler methods
such as run-length encoding, the term is doubly appropriate. (This
meaning is usually used in the construction file crunch(ing) to
distinguish it from
`*number-crunching* <../N/number-crunching.html>`__.) See
`*compress* <compress.html>`__.

3. n. The character ``#``. Used at XEROX and CMU, among other places.
See `*ASCII* <../A/ASCII.html>`__.

4. vt. To squeeze program source into a minimum-size representation that
will still compile or execute. The term came into being specifically for
a famous program on the BBC micro that crunched BASIC source in order to
make it run more quickly (it was a wholly interpretive BASIC, so the
number of characters mattered). `*Obfuscated C
Contest* <../O/Obfuscated-C-Contest.html>`__ entries are often crunched;
see the first example under that entry.

The tray of a CD-ROM drive, or by extension the CD drive itself. So
called because of a common tech support legend about the idiot who
called to complain that the cup holder on his computer broke. A joke
program was once distributed around the net called “cupholder.exe”,
which when run simply extended the CD drive tray. The humor of this was
of course lost on people whose drive had a slot or a caddy instead.

**cursor dipped in X**: n.

There are a couple of metaphors in English of the form ‘pen dipped in X’
(perhaps the most common values of X are ‘acid’, ‘bile’, and ‘vitriol’).
These map over neatly to this hackish usage (the cursor being what
moves, leaving letters behind, when one is composing on-line). “Talk
about a `*nastygram* <../N/nastygram.html>`__! He must've had his cursor
dipped in acid when he wrote that one!”

**cut a tape**: vi.

To write a software or document distribution on magnetic tape for
shipment. Has nothing to do with physically cutting the medium! Early
versions of this lexicon claimed that one never analogously speaks of
‘cutting a disk’, but this has since been reported as live usage.
Related slang usages are mainstream business's ‘cut a check’, the
recording industry's ‘cut a record’, and the military's ‘cut an order’.

All of these usages reflect physical processes in obsolete recording and
duplication technologies. The first stage in manufacturing an old-style
vinyl record involved cutting grooves in a stamping die with a precision
lathe. More mundanely, the dominant technology for mass duplication of
paper documents in pre-photocopying days involved “cutting a stencil”,
punching away portions of the wax overlay on a silk screen. More
directly, paper tape with holes punched in it was an important early
storage medium. See also `*burn a CD* <../B/burn-a-CD.html>`__.

bureaucratese.

2. Incomprehensible stuff embedded in email. First there were the
“Received” headers that show how mail flows through systems, then MIME
(Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions) headers and part boundaries,
and now huge blocks of radix-64 for PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) or PGP
(Pretty Good Privacy) digital signatures and certificates of
authenticity. This stuff all serves a purpose and good user interfaces
should hide it, but all too often users are forced to wade through it.

**cyberpunk**: /si:´ber·puhnk/, n.,adj.

[orig. by SF writer Bruce Bethke and/or editor Gardner Dozois] A
subgenre of SF launched in 1982 by William Gibson's epoch-making novel
*Neuromancer* (though its roots go back through Vernor Vinge's *True
Names* (see the `Bibliography <../pt03.html#bibliography>`__ in Appendix
C) to John Brunner's 1975 novel *The Shockwave Rider*). Gibson's
near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture
enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the
future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly naïve and
tremendously stimulating. Gibson's work was widely imitated, in
particular by the short-lived but innovative *Max Headroom* TV series.
See `*cyberspace* <cyberspace.html>`__, `*ice* <../I/ice.html>`__,
`*jack in* <../J/jack-in.html>`__, `*go
flatline* <../G/go-flatline.html>`__.

Since 1990 or so, popular culture has included a movement or fashion
trend that calls itself ‘cyberpunk’, associated especially with the
rave/techno subculture. Hackers have mixed feelings about this. On the
one hand, self-described cyberpunks too often seem to be shallow
trendoids in black leather who have substituted enthusiastic blathering
about technology for actually learning and *doing* it. Attitude is no
substitute for competence. On the other hand, at least cyberpunks are
excited about the right things and properly respectful of hacking talent
in those who have it. The general consensus is to tolerate them politely
in hopes that they'll attract people who grow into being true hackers.

--------------

**cyberspace**: /si:´br·spays\`/, n.

1. Notional ‘information-space’ loaded with visual cues and navigable
with brain-computer interfaces called cyberspace decks; a characteristic
prop of `*cyberpunk* <cyberpunk.html>`__ SF. Serious efforts to
construct `*virtual reality* <../V/virtual-reality.html>`__ interfaces
modeled explicitly on Gibsonian cyberspace are under way, using more
conventional devices such as glove sensors and binocular TV headsets.
Few hackers are prepared to deny outright the possibility of a
cyberspace someday evolving out of the network (see `*the
network* <../T/the-network.html>`__).

2. The Internet or `*Matrix* <../M/Matrix.html>`__ (sense #2) as a
whole, considered as a crude cyberspace (sense 1). Although this usage
became widely popular in the mainstream press during 1994 when the
Internet exploded into public awareness, it is strongly deprecated among
hackers because the Internet does not meet the high, SF-inspired
standards they have for true cyberspace technology. Thus, this use of
the term usually tags a `*wannabee* <../W/wannabee.html>`__ or outsider.
Oppose `*meatspace* <../M/meatspace.html>`__.

3. Occasionally, the metaphoric location of the mind of a person in
`*hack mode* <../H/hack-mode.html>`__. Some hackers report experiencing
strong synesthetic imagery when in hack mode; interestingly, independent
reports from multiple sources suggest that there are common features to
the experience. In particular, the dominant colors of this subjective
cyberspace are often gray and silver, and the imagery often involves
constellations of marching dots, elaborate shifting patterns of lines
and angles, or moire patterns.

**cycle**

1. n. The basic unit of computation. What every hacker wants more of
(noted hacker Bill Gosper described himself as a “cycle junkie”). One
can describe an instruction as taking so many clock cycles. Often the
computer can access its memory once on every clock cycle, and so one
speaks also of memory cycles. These are technical meanings of
`*cycle* <cycle.html>`__. The jargon meaning comes from the observation
that there are only so many cycles per second, and when you are sharing
a computer the cycles get divided up among the users. The more cycles
the computer spends working on your program rather than someone else's,
the faster your program will run. That's why every hacker wants more
cycles: so he can spend less time waiting for the computer to respond.

2. By extension, a notional unit of *human* thought power, emphasizing
that lots of things compete for the typical hacker's think time. “I
refused to get involved with the Rubik's Cube back when it was big. Knew
I'd burn too many cycles on it if I let myself.”

3. vt. Syn. `*bounce* <../B/bounce.html>`__ (sense 4), from the phrase
‘cycle power’. “Cycle the machine again, that serial port's still hung.”
