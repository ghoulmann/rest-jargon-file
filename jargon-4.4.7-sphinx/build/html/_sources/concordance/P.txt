packet over air
====================

**packet over air**

[common among backbone ISPs] The protocol notionally being used by
Internet data attempting to traverse a physical gap or break in the
network, such as might be caused by a `*fiber-seeking
backhoe* <../F/fiber-seeking-backhoe.html>`__. “I see why you're
dropping packets. You seem to have a packet over air problem.”
 

padded cell
================

**padded cell**: n.

Where you put `*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__\ s so they can't hurt
anything. A program that limits a luser to a carefully restricted subset
of the capabilities of the host system (for example, the rsh(1) utility
on USG Unix). Note that this is different from an `*iron
box* <../I/iron-box.html>`__ because it is overt and not aimed at
enforcing security so much as protecting others (and the luser) from the
consequences of the luser's boundless naivete (see
`*naive* <../N/naive.html>`__). Also padded cell environment.

 

page in
====================

**page in**: v.

[MIT]

1. To become aware of one's surroundings again after having paged out
(see `*page out* <page-out.html>`__). Usually confined to the sarcastic
comment: “Eric pages in, `*film at 11* <../F/film-at-11.html>`__!”

2. Syn. swap in; see `*swap* <../S/swap.html>`__.

 

page out
================

**page out**: vi.

[MIT]

1. To become unaware of one's surroundings temporarily, due to
daydreaming or preoccupation. “Can you repeat that? I paged out for a
minute.” See `*page in* <page-in.html>`__. Compare
`*glitch* <../G/glitch.html>`__, `*thinko* <../T/thinko.html>`__.

2. Syn. swap out; see `*swap* <../S/swap.html>`__.

 

pain in the net
===========================

**pain in the net**: n.

A `*flamer* <../F/flamer.html>`__.



paper-net
================

**paper-net**: n.

Hackish way of referring to the postal service, analogizing it to a very
slow, low-reliability network. Usenet `*sig
block* <../S/sig-block.html>`__\ s sometimes include a “Paper-Net:”
header just before the sender's postal address; common variants of this
are “Papernet” and “P-Net”. Note that the standard
`*netiquette* <../N/netiquette.html>`__ guidelines discourage this
practice as a waste of bandwidth, since netters are quite unlikely to
casually use postal addresses. Compare
`*voice-net* <../V/voice-net.html>`__,
`*snail-mail* <../S/snail-mail.html>`__.

 

param
============

**param**: /p@·ram´/, n.

[common] Shorthand for parameter. See also `*parm* <parm.html>`__;
compare `*arg* <../A/arg.html>`__, `*var* <../V/var.html>`__.

PARC
============

**PARC**: n.

See `*XEROX PARC* <../X/XEROX-PARC.html>`__.

 

parent message
=================

**parent message**: n.

What a `*followup* <../F/followup.html>`__ follows up.


parity errors
=================

**parity errors**: pl.n.

Little lapses of attention or (in more severe cases) consciousness,
usually brought on by having spent all night and most of the next day
hacking. “I need to go home and crash; I'm starting to get a lot of
parity errors.” Derives from a relatively common but nearly always
correctable transient error in memory hardware. It predates RAM; in
fact, this term is reported to have already have been in use in its
jargon sense back in the 1960s when magnetic cores ruled. Parity errors
can also afflict mass storage and serial communication lines; this is
more serious because not always correctable.

 

Parkinson's Law of Data
===========================

**Parkinson's Law of Data**: prov.

“Data expands to fill the space available for storage”; buying more
memory encourages the use of more memory-intensive techniques. (The
original 1958 Parkinson's Law described the structural tendency of
bureaucracies to make work for themselves.) It has been observed since
the mid-1980s that the memory usage of evolving systems tends to double
roughly once every 18 months. Fortunately, memory density available for
constant dollars also tends to about double once every 18 months (see
`*Moore's Law* <../M/Moores-Law.html>`__); unfortunately, the laws of
physics guarantee that the latter cannot continue indefinitely.

 

parm
====================

**parm**: /parm/, n.

Further-compressed form of `*param* <param.html>`__. This term is an
*IBMism*, and written use is almost unknown outside IBM shops; spoken
/parm/ is more widely distributed, but the synonym
`*arg* <../A/arg.html>`__ is favored among hackers. Compare
`*arg* <../A/arg.html>`__, `*var* <../V/var.html>`__.

 

parse
=================

**parse**: vt.

1. To determine the syntactic structure of a sentence or other utterance
(close to the standard English meaning). “That was the one I saw you.”
“I can't parse that.”

2. More generally, to understand or comprehend. “It's very simple; you
just kretch the glims and then aos the zotz.” “I can't parse that.”

3. Of fish, to have to remove the bones yourself. “I object to parsing
fish”, means “I don't want to get a whole fish, but a sliced one is
okay”. A parsed fish has been deboned. There is some controversy over
whether unparsed should mean ‘bony’, or also mean ‘deboned’.

PascalCasing
==================

**PascalCasing**

The practice of marking all word boundaries in long identifiers (such as
ThisIsASampleVariable) (including the first letter of the identifier)
with uppercase. Constrasts with camelCasing, in which the first
character of the identifier is left in lowercase
(thisIsASampleVariable), and with the traditional C style of short
all-lower-case names with internal word breaks marked by an underscore
(sample\_var).

Where these terms are used, they usually go with advice to use
PascalCasing for public interfaces and camelCasing for private ones.
They may have originated at Microsoft, but are in more general use in
ECMA standards, among Java programmers, and elsewhere.

Pascal
======================

**Pascal**: n.

An Algol-descended language designed by Niklaus Wirth on the CDC 6600
around 1967--68 as an instructional tool for elementary programming.
This language, designed primarily to keep students from shooting
themselves in the foot and thus extremely restrictive from a
general-purpose-programming point of view, was later promoted as a
general-purpose tool and, in fact, became the ancestor of a large family
of languages including Modula-2 and Ada (see also
`*bondage-and-discipline
language* <../B/bondage-and-discipline-language.html>`__). The hackish
point of view on Pascal was probably best summed up by a devastating
(and, in its deadpan way, screamingly funny) 1981 paper by Brian
Kernighan (of `*K&R* <../K/K-ampersand-R.html>`__ fame) entitled *Why
Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language*, which was turned down
by the technical journals but circulated widely via photocopies. It was
eventually published in *Comparing and Assessing Programming Languages*,
edited by Alan Feuer and Narain Gehani (Prentice-Hall, 1984). Part of
his discussion is worth repeating here, because its criticisms are still
apposite to Pascal itself after many years of improvement and could also
stand as an indictment of many other bondage-and-discipline languages.
(The entire essay is available at
`http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html <http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html>`__.)
At the end of a summary of the case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote:

    9. There is no escape

    This last point is perhaps the most important. The language is
    inadequate but circumscribed, because there is no way to escape its
    limitations. There are no casts to disable the type-checking when
    necessary. There is no way to replace the defective run-time
    environment with a sensible one, unless one controls the compiler
    that defines the “standard procedures”. The language is closed.

    People who use Pascal for serious programming fall into a fatal
    trap. Because the language is impotent, it must be extended. But
    each group extends Pascal in its own direction, to make it look like
    whatever language they really want. Extensions for separate
    compilation, FORTRAN-like COMMON, string data types, internal static
    variables, initialization, octal numbers, bit operators, etc., all
    add to the utility of the language for one group but destroy its
    portability to others.

    I feel that it is a mistake to use Pascal for anything much beyond
    its original target. In its pure form, Pascal is a toy language,
    suitable for teaching but not for real programming.

Pascal has since been entirely displaced (mainly by
`*C* <../C/C.html>`__) from the niches it had acquired in serious
applications and systems programming, and from its role as a teaching
language by Java.
 

pastie
================

**pastie**: /pay´stee/, n.

An adhesive-backed label designed to be attached to a key on a keyboard
to indicate some non-standard character which can be accessed through
that key. Pasties are likely to be used in APL environments, where
almost every key is associated with a special character. A pastie on the
R key, for example, might remind the user that it is used to generate
the ρ character. The term properly refers to nipple-concealing devices
formerly worn by strippers in concession to indecent-exposure laws;
compare `*tits on a keyboard* <../T/tits-on-a-keyboard.html>`__.



patch
=============

**patch**

1. n. A temporary addition to a piece of code, usually as a
`*quick-and-dirty* <../Q/quick-and-dirty.html>`__ remedy to an existing
bug or misfeature. A patch may or may not work, and may or may not
eventually be incorporated permanently into the program. Distinguished
from a `*diff* <../D/diff.html>`__ or `*mod* <../M/mod.html>`__ by the
fact that a patch is generated by more primitive means than the rest of
the program; the classical examples are instructions modified by using
the front panel switches, and changes made directly to the binary
executable of a program originally written in an
`*HLL* <../H/HLL.html>`__. Compare `*one-line
fix* <../O/one-line-fix.html>`__.

2. vt. To insert a patch into a piece of code.

3. [in the Unix world] n. A `*diff* <../D/diff.html>`__ (sense 2).

4. A set of modifications to binaries to be applied by a patching
program. IBM operating systems often receive updates to the operating
system in the form of absolute hexadecimal patches. If you have modified
your OS, you have to disassemble these back to the source. The patches
might later be corrected by other patches on top of them (patches were
said to “grow scar tissue”). The result was often a convoluted `*patch
space* <patch-space.html>`__ and headaches galore.

5. [Unix] the patch(1) program, written by Larry Wall, which
automatically applies a patch (sense 3) to a set of source code.

There is a classic story of a `*tiger team* <../T/tiger-team.html>`__
penetrating a secure military computer that illustrates the danger
inherent in binary patches (or, indeed, any patches that you can't — or
don't — inspect and examine before installing). They couldn't find any
`*trap door* <../T/trap-door.html>`__\ s or any way to penetrate
security of IBM's OS, so they made a site visit to an IBM office
(remember, these were official military types who were purportedly on
official business), swiped some IBM stationery, and created a fake
patch. The patch was actually the trapdoor they needed. The patch was
distributed at about the right time for an IBM patch, had official
stationery and all accompanying documentation, and was dutifully
installed. The installation manager very shortly thereafter learned
something about proper procedures.

 

patch pumpkin
=====================

**patch pumpkin**: n.

[Perl hackers] A notional token passed around among the members of a
project. Possession of the patch pumpkin means one has the exclusive
authority to make changes on the project's master source tree. The
implicit assumption is that pumpkin holder status is temporary and
rotates periodically among senior project members.

This term comes from the Perl development community, but has been
sighted elsewhere. It derives from a stuffed-toy pumpkin that was passed
around at a development shop years ago as the access control for a
shared backup-tape drive.

 

patch space
=====================

**patch space**: n.

An unused block of bits left in a binary so that it can later be
modified by insertion of machine-language instructions there (typically,
the patch space is modified to contain new code, and the superseded code
is patched to contain a jump or call to the patch space). The
near-universal use of compilers and interpreters has made this term
rare; it is now primarily historical outside IBM shops. See
`*patch* <patch.html>`__ (sense 4), `*zap* <../Z/zap.html>`__ (sense 4),
`*hook* <../H/hook.html>`__.

 

path
=============

**path**: n.

1. A `*bang path* <../B/bang-path.html>`__ or explicitly routed Internet
address; a node-by-node specification of a link between two machines.
Though these are now obsolete as a form of addressing, they still show
up in diagnostics and trace headers occasionally (e.g. in NNTP headers).

2. [Unix] A filename, fully specified relative to the root directory (as
opposed to relative to the current directory; the latter is sometimes
called a relative path). This is also called a pathname.

3. [Unix and MS-DOS/Windows] The search path, an environment variable
specifying the directories in which the `*shell* <../S/shell.html>`__
(COMMAND.COM, under MS-DOS) should look for commands. Other, similar
constructs abound under Unix (for example, the C preprocessor has a
search path it uses in looking for **#include** files).

 

pathological
====================

**pathological**: adj.

1. [scientific computation] Used of a data set that is grossly atypical
of normal expected input, esp. one that exposes a weakness or bug in
whatever algorithm one is using. An algorithm that can be broken by
pathological inputs may still be useful if such inputs are very unlikely
to occur in practice.

2. When used of test input, implies that it was purposefully engineered
as a worst case. The implication in both senses is that the data is
spectacularly ill-conditioned or that someone had to explicitly set out
to break the algorithm in order to come up with such a crazy example.

3. Also said of an unlikely collection of circumstances. “If the network
is down and comes up halfway through the execution of that command by
root, the system may just crash.” “Yes, but that's a pathological case.”
Often used to dismiss the case from discussion, with the implication
that the consequences are acceptable, since they will happen so
infrequently (if at all) that it doesn't seem worth going to the extra
trouble to handle that case (see sense 1).

payware
==============

**payware**: /pay´weir/, n.

Commercial software. Oppose `*shareware* <../S/shareware.html>`__ or
`*freeware* <../F/freeware.html>`__.

PBD
========

**PBD**: /P·B·D/, n.

[abbrev. of ‘Programmer Brain Damage’] Applied to bug reports revealing
places where the program was obviously broken by an incompetent or
short-sighted programmer. Compare `*UBD* <../U/UBD.html>`__; see also
`*brain-damaged* <../B/brain-damaged.html>`__.

PD
=====
 

**PD**: /P·D/, adj.

[common] Abbreviation for ‘public domain’, applied to software
distributed over `*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__ and from Internet
archive sites. Much of this software is not in fact public domain in the
legal sense but travels under various copyrights granting reproduction
and use rights to anyone who can `*snarf* <../S/snarf.html>`__ a copy.
See `*copyleft* <../C/copyleft.html>`__.

PDP-10
=============

**PDP-10**: n.

[Programmed Data Processor model 10] The machine that made
`*timesharing* <../T/timesharing.html>`__ real. It looms large in hacker
folklore because of its adoption in the mid-1970s by many university
computing facilities and research labs, including the MIT AI Lab,
Stanford, and CMU. Some aspects of the instruction set (most notably the
bit-field instructions) are still considered unsurpassed. The 10 was
eventually eclipsed by the `*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__ machines
(descendants of the `*PDP-11* <PDP-11.html>`__) when
`*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__ recognized that the 10 and
`*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__ product lines were competing with each other
and decided to concentrate its software development effort on the more
profitable `*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__. The machine was finally dropped
from DEC's line in 1983, following the failure of the Jupiter Project at
DEC to build a viable new model. (Some attempts by other companies to
market clones came to nothing; see `*Foonly* <../F/Foonly.html>`__ and
`*Mars* <../M/Mars.html>`__.) This event spelled the doom of
`*ITS* <../I/ITS.html>`__ and the technical cultures that had spawned
the original Jargon File, but by mid-1991 it had become something of a
badge of honorable old-timerhood among hackers to have cut one's teeth
on a PDP-10. See `*TOPS-10* <../T/TOPS-10.html>`__,
`*ITS* <../I/ITS.html>`__, `*BLT* <../B/BLT.html>`__,
`*DDT* <../D/DDT.html>`__, `*EXCH* <../E/EXCH.html>`__,
`*HAKMEM* <../H/HAKMEM.html>`__, `*pop* <pop.html>`__,
`*push* <push.html>`__. See also
`http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/ <http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/>`__.

PDP-11
=========

**PDP-11**

Possibly the single most successful minicomputer design in history, a
favorite of hackers for many years, and the first major Unix machine,
The first PDP-11s (the 11/15 and 11/20) shipped in 1970 from
`*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__; the last (11/93 and 11/94) in 1990. Along the
way, the 11 gave birth to the `*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__, strongly
influenced the design of microprocessors such as the Motorola 6800 and
Intel 386, and left a permanent imprint on the C language (which has an
odd preference for octal embedded in its syntax because of the way
PDP-11 machine instructions were formatted). There is a `history
site <http://telnet.hu/hamster/pdp-11/>`__.

PDP-20
================

**PDP-20**: n.

The most famous computer that never was. `*PDP-10* <PDP-10.html>`__
computers running the `*TOPS-10* <../T/TOPS-10.html>`__ operating system
were labeled ‘DECsystem-10’ as a way of differentiating them from the
`*PDP-11* <PDP-11.html>`__. Later on, those systems running
`*TOPS-20* <../T/TOPS-20.html>`__ were labeled ‘DECSYSTEM-20’ (the block
capitals being the result of a lawsuit brought against DEC by Singer,
which once made a computer called ‘system-10’), but contrary to popular
lore there was never a ‘PDP-20’; the only difference between a 10 and a
20 was the operating system and the color of the paint. Most (but not
all) machines sold to run TOPS-10 were painted ‘Basil Blue’, whereas
most TOPS-20 machines were painted ‘Chinese Red’ (often mistakenly
called orange).
 
PEBKAC
=============

**PEBKAC**: /peb´kak/

[Abbrev., “Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair”] Used by support
people, particularly at call centers and help desks. Not used with the
public. Denotes pilot error as the cause of the crash, especially stupid
errors that even a `*luser* <../L/luser.html>`__ could figure out. Very
derogatory. Usage: “Did you ever figure out why that guy couldn't
print?” “Yeah, he kept cancelling the operation before it could finish.
PEBKAC”. See also `*ID10T* <../I/idiot.html>`__. Compare `*pilot
error* <pilot-error.html>`__, `*UBD* <../U/UBD.html>`__.

peek
==========

**peek**: n.,vt.

(and `*poke* <poke.html>`__) The commands in most microcomputer BASICs
for directly accessing memory contents at an absolute address; often
extended to mean the corresponding constructs in any
`*HLL* <../H/HLL.html>`__ (peek reads memory, poke modifies it). Much
hacking on small, non-MMU micros used to consist of peeking around
memory, more or less at random, to find the location where the system
keeps interesting stuff. Long (and variably accurate) lists of such
addresses for various computers circulated. The results of pokes at
these addresses may be highly useful, mildly amusing, useless but neat,
or (most likely) total `*lossage* <../L/lossage.html>`__ (see `*killer
poke* <../K/killer-poke.html>`__).

Since a `*real operating system* <../R/real-operating-system.html>`__
provides useful, higher-level services for the tasks commonly performed
with peeks and pokes on micros, and real languages tend not to encourage
low-level memory groveling, a question like “How do I do a peek in C?”
is diagnostic of the `*newbie* <../N/newbie.html>`__. (Of course, OS
kernels often have to do exactly this; a real kernel hacker would
unhesitatingly, if unportably, assign an absolute address to a pointer
variable and indirect through it.)

 

pencil and paper
===================

**pencil and paper**: n.

An archaic information storage and transmission device that works by
depositing smears of graphite on bleached wood pulp. More recent
developments in paper-based technology include improved ‘write-once’
update devices which use tiny rolling heads similar to mouse balls to
deposit colored pigment. All these devices require an operator skilled
at so-called ‘handwriting’ technique. These technologies are ubiquitous
outside hackerdom, but nearly forgotten inside it. Most hackers had
terrible handwriting to begin with, and years of keyboarding tend to
have encouraged it to degrade further. Perhaps for this reason, hackers
deprecate pencil-and-paper technology and often resist using it in any
but the most trivial contexts.

 

Pentagram Pro
==================

**Pentagram Pro**: n.

A humorous corruption of “Pentium Pro”, with a Satanic reference,
implying that the chip is inherently `*evil* <../E/evil.html>`__. Often
used with “666 MHz”; there is a T-shirt. See
`*Pentium* <Pentium.html>`__


Pentium
===================

**Pentium**: n.

The name given to Intel's P5 chip, the successor to the 80486. The name
was chosen because of difficulties Intel had in trademarking a number.
It suggests the number five (implying 586) while (according to Intel)
conveying a meaning of strength “like titanium”. Among hackers, the
plural is frequently ‘pentia’. See also `*Pentagram
Pro* <Pentagram-Pro.html>`__.

Intel did not stick to this convention when naming its P6 processor the
Pentium Pro; many believe this is due to difficulties in selling a chip
with “hex” or “sex” in its name. Successor chips have been called
Pentium II, Pentium III, and Pentium IV.

 

peon
=============

**peon**: n.

A person with no special (`*root* <../R/root.html>`__ or
`*wheel* <../W/wheel.html>`__) privileges on a computer system. “I can't
create an account on *foovax* for you; I'm only a peon there.”

 

percent-S
==============

**percent-S**: /per·sent´ es´/, n.

[From the code in C's printf(3) library function used to insert an
arbitrary string argument] An unspecified person or object. “I was just
talking to some percent-s in administration.” Compare
`*random* <../R/random.html>`__.

perfect programmer syndrome
===============================

**perfect programmer syndrome**: n.

Arrogance; the egotistical conviction that one is above normal human
error. Most frequently found among programmers of some native ability
but relatively little experience (especially new graduates; their
perceptions may be distorted by a history of excellent performance at
solving `*toy problem* <../T/toy-problem.html>`__\ s). “Of course my
program is correct, there is no need to test it.” “Yes, I can see there
may be a problem here, but *I'll* never type **rm -r /** while in `*root
mode* <../R/root-mode.html>`__.”

perf
======
 

**perf**: /perf/, n.

Syn. `*chad* <../C/chad.html>`__ (sense 1). The term perfory
/per´f@-ree/ is also heard. The term `*perf* <perf.html>`__ may also
refer to the perforations themselves, rather than the chad they produce
when torn (philatelists use it this way).
 

Perl
================ 

**Perl**: /perl/, n.

[Practical Extraction and Report Language, a.k.a. Pathologically
Eclectic Rubbish Lister] An interpreted language developed by Larry
Wall, author of patch(1) and rn(1)). Superficially resembles
`*awk* <../A/awk.html>`__, but is much hairier, including many
facilities reminiscent of sed(1) and shells and a comprehensive Unix
system-call interface. Unix sysadmins, who are almost always
incorrigible hackers, generally consider it one of the `*languages of
choice* <../L/languages-of-choice.html>`__, and it is by far the most
widely used tool for making ‘live’ web pages via CGI. Perl has been
described, in a parody of a famous remark about lex(1), as the
`*Swiss-Army chainsaw* <../S/Swiss-Army-chainsaw.html>`__ of Unix
programming. Though Perl is very useful, it would be a stretch to
describe it as pretty or `*elegant* <../E/elegant.html>`__; people who
like clean, spare design generally prefer `*Python* <Python.html>`__.
See also `*Camel Book* <../C/Camel-Book.html>`__,
`*TMTOWTDI* <../T/TMTOWTDI.html>`__.


person of no account
===================================

**person of no account**: n.

[University of California at Santa Cruz] Used when referring to a person
with no `*network address* <../N/network-address.html>`__, frequently to
forestall confusion. Most often as part of an introduction: “This is
Bill, a person of no account, but he used to be bill@random.com”.
Compare `*return from the dead* <../R/return-from-the-dead.html>`__.

pessimal
================

**pessimal**: /pes´im·l/, adj.

[Latin-based antonym for optimal] Maximally bad. “This is a pessimal
situation.” Also pessimize vt. To make as bad as possible. These words
are the obvious Latin-based antonyms for optimal and optimize, but for
some reason they do not appear in most English dictionaries, although
‘pessimize’ is listed in the OED.
 

pessimizing compiler
=======================

**pessimizing compiler**: /pes'@·mi:z\`ing k@m·pi:l´r/, n.

[antonym of techspeak ‘optimizing compiler’] A compiler that produces
object code that is worse than the straightforward or obvious hand
translation. The implication is that the compiler is actually trying to
optimize the program, but through excessive cleverness is doing the
opposite. A few pessimizing compilers have been written on purpose,
however, as pranks or burlesques.

peta-
===========

**peta-**: /pe´t@/

[SI] See `*quantifiers* <../Q/quantifiers.html>`__.



pffft
==================
--------------

**pffft**: interj.

[IRC] A metamorphic expletive which can be used to convey emotion,
particularly shock or surprise, disgust or anger. The amplitude of the
reaction can be measured by counting intermediary fs. For example:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .. code:: screen                                                         |

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

PFY
========

**PFY**: n.

[Usenet; common, originally from the `*BOFH* <../B/BOFH.html>`__ mythos]
Abbreviation for Pimply-Faced Youth. A `*BOFH* <../B/BOFH.html>`__ in
training, esp. one apprenticed to an elder BOFH aged in evil.


phage
============

**phage**: n.

A program that modifies other programs or databases in unauthorized
ways; esp. one that propagates a `*virus* <../V/virus.html>`__ or
`*Trojan horse* <../T/Trojan-horse.html>`__. See also
`*worm* <../W/worm.html>`__, `*mockingbird* <../M/mockingbird.html>`__.
The analogy, of course, is with phage viruses in biology.

phase
============
 

**phase**

1. n. The offset of one's waking-sleeping schedule with respect to the
standard 24-hour cycle; a useful concept among people who often work at
night and/or according to no fixed schedule. It is not uncommon to
change one's phase by as much as 6 hours per day on a regular basis.
“What's your phase?” “I've been getting in about 8PM lately, but I'm
going to `*wrap around* <../W/wrap-around.html>`__ to the day schedule
by Friday.” A person who is roughly 12 hours out of phase is sometimes
said to be in night mode. (The term day mode is also (but less
frequently) used, meaning you're working 9 to 5 (or, more likely, 10 to
6).) The act of altering one's cycle is called changing phase; phase
shifting has also been recently reported from Caltech.

2. change phase the hard way: To stay awake for a very long time in
order to get into a different phase.

3. change phase the easy way: To stay asleep, etc. However, some claim
that either staying awake longer or sleeping longer is easy, and that it
is *shortening* your day or night that is really hard (see `*wrap
around* <../W/wrap-around.html>`__). The ‘jet lag’ that afflicts
travelers who cross many time-zone boundaries may be attributed to two
distinct causes: the strain of travel per se, and the strain of changing
phase. Hackers who suddenly find that they must change phase drastically
in a short period of time, particularly the hard way, experience
something very like jet lag without traveling.

 

phase of the moon
======================

**phase of the moon**: n.

Used humorously as a random parameter on which something is said to
depend. Sometimes implies unreliability of whatever is dependent, or
that reliability seems to be dependent on conditions nobody has been
able to determine. “This feature depends on having the channel open in
mumble mode, having the foo switch set, and on the phase of the moon.”
See also `*heisenbug* <../H/heisenbug.html>`__.

True story: Once upon a time there was a program bug that really did
depend on the phase of the moon. There was a little subroutine that had
traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an
approximation to the moon's true phase. GLS incorporated this routine
into a LISP program that, when it wrote out a file, would print a
timestamp line almost 80 characters long. Very occasionally the first
line of the message would be too long and would overflow onto the next
line, and when the file was later read back in the program would
`*barf* <../B/barf.html>`__. The length of the first line depended on
both the precise date and time and the length of the phase specification
when the timestamp was printed, and so the bug literally depended on the
phase of the moon!

The first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983) included an
example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug, but the
typesetter ‘corrected’ it. This has since been described as the
phase-of-the-moon-bug bug.

However, beware of assumptions. A few years ago, engineers of CERN
(European Center for Nuclear Research) were baffled by some errors in
experiments conducted with the LEP particle accelerator. As the
formidable amount of data generated by such devices is heavily processed
by computers before being seen by humans, many people suggested the
software was somehow sensitive to the phase of the moon. A few desperate
engineers discovered the truth; the error turned out to be the result of
a tiny change in the geometry of the 27km circumference ring, physically
caused by the deformation of the Earth by the passage of the Moon! This
story has entered physics folklore as a Newtonian vengeance on particle
physics and as an example of the relevance of the simplest and oldest
physical laws to the most modern science.

 

phase-wrapping
=================

**phase-wrapping**: n.

[MIT] Syn. `*wrap around* <../W/wrap-around.html>`__, sense 2.



PHB
==========

**PHB**: /P·H·B/

[Usenet; common; rarely spoken] Abbreviation, “Pointy-Haired Boss”. From
the `*Dilbert* <../D/Dilbert.html>`__ character, the archetypal
halfwitted middle-`*management* <../M/management.html>`__ type. See also
`*pointy-haired* <pointy-haired.html>`__.

 

phreaker
====================

**phreaker**: /freek´r/, n.

One who engages in `*phreaking* <phreaking.html>`__. See also `*blue
box* <../B/blue-box.html>`__.

phreaking
=============

**phreaking**: /freek´ing/, n.

[from ‘phone phreak’]

1. The art and science of `*cracking* <../C/cracking.html>`__ the phone
network (so as, for example, to make free long-distance calls).

2. By extension, security-cracking in any other context (especially, but
not exclusively, on communications networks) (see
`*cracking* <../C/cracking.html>`__).

At one time phreaking was a semi-respectable activity among hackers;
there was a gentleman's agreement that phreaking as an intellectual game
and a form of exploration was OK, but serious theft of services was
taboo. There was significant crossover between the hacker community and
the hard-core phone phreaks who ran semi-underground networks of their
own through such media as the legendary *TAP Newsletter*. This ethos
began to break down in the mid-1980s as wider dissemination of the
techniques put them in the hands of less responsible phreaks. Around the
same time, changes in the phone network made old-style technical
ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it, so phreaking came to
depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phone-card
numbers. The crimes and punishments of gangs like the ‘414 group’ turned
that game very ugly. A few old-time hackers still phreak casually just
to keep their hand in, but most these days have hardly even heard of
‘blue boxes’ or any of the other paraphernalia of the great phreaks of
yore.
 
pico-
===============

**pico-**: pref.

[SI: a quantifier meaning × 10\ :sup:`-12`] Smaller than
`*nano-* <../N/nano-.html>`__; used in the same rather loose connotative
way as `*nano-* <../N/nano-.html>`__ and
`*micro-* <../M/micro-.html>`__. This usage is not yet common in the way
`*nano-* <../N/nano-.html>`__ and `*micro-* <../M/micro-.html>`__ are,
but should be instantly recognizable to any hacker. See also
`*quantifiers* <../Q/quantifiers.html>`__,
`*micro-* <../M/micro-.html>`__.

 

pig-tail
============

**pig-tail**

[radio hams] A short piece of cable with two connectors on each end for
converting between one connector type and another. Common pig-tails are
9-to-25-pin serial-port converters and cables to connect PCMCIA network
cards to an RJ-45 network cable.
 

pilot error
=============

**pilot error**: n.

[Sun: from aviation] A user's misconfiguration or misuse of a piece of
software, producing apparently buglike results (compare
`*UBD* <../U/UBD.html>`__). “Joe Luser reported a bug in sendmail that
causes it to generate bogus headers.” “That's not a bug, that's pilot
error. His **sendmail.cf** is hosed.” Compare
`*PEBKAC* <PEBKAC.html>`__, `*UBD* <../U/UBD.html>`__,
`*ID10T* <../I/idiot.html>`__.
 
ping
===========
 

**ping**

[from the submariners' term for a sonar pulse]

1. n. Slang term for a small network message (ICMP ECHO) sent by a
computer to check for the presence and alertness of another. The Unix
command ping(8) can be used to do this manually (note that ping(8)'s
author denies the widespread folk etymology that the name was ever
intended as an acronym for ‘Packet INternet Groper’). Occasionally used
as a phone greeting. See `*ACK* <../A/ACK.html>`__, also
`*ENQ* <../E/ENQ.html>`__.

2. vt. To verify the presence of.

3. vt. To get the attention of.

4. vt. To send a message to all members of a `*mailing
list* <../M/mailing-list.html>`__ requesting an
`*ACK* <../A/ACK.html>`__ (in order to verify that everybody's addresses
are reachable). “We haven't heard much of anything from Geoff, but he
did respond with an ACK both times I pinged jargon-friends.”

5. n. A quantum packet of happiness. People who are very happy tend to
exude pings; furthermore, one can intentionally create pings and aim
them at a needy party (e.g., a depressed person). This sense of ping may
appear as an exclamation; “Ping!” (I'm happy; I am emitting a quantum of
happiness; I have been struck by a quantum of happiness). The form
“pingfulness”, which is used to describe people who exude pings, also
occurs. (In the standard abuse of language, “pingfulness” can also be
used as an exclamation, in which case it's a much stronger exclamation
than just “ping”!). Oppose `*blargh* <../B/blargh.html>`__.

The funniest use of ‘ping’ to date was
`described <http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1991Jan23.211609.877%40news.cs.indiana.edu>`__
in January 1991 by Steve Hayman on the Usenet group ``comp.sys.next``.
He was trying to isolate a faulty cable segment on a TCP/IP Ethernet
hooked up to a NeXT machine, and got tired of having to run back to his
console after each cabling tweak to see if the ping packets were getting
through. So he used the sound-recording feature on the NeXT, then wrote
a script that repeatedly invoked ping(8), listened for an echo, and
played back the recording on each returned packet. Result? A program
that caused the machine to repeat, over and over, “Ping ... ping ...
ping ...” as long as the network was up. He turned the volume to
maximum, ferreted through the building with one ear cocked, and found a
faulty tee connector in no time.

 

Ping O' Death
==================

 

**Ping O' Death**: n.

A notorious `*exploit* <../E/exploit.html>`__ that (when first
discovered) could be easily used to crash a wide variety of machines by
overrunning size limits in their TCP/IP stacks. First revealed in late
1996. The open-source Unix community patched its systems to remove the
vulnerability within days or weeks, the closed-source OS vendors
generally took months. While the difference in response times repeated a
pattern familiar from other security incidents, the accompanying glare
of Web-fueled publicity proved unusually embarrassing to the OS vendors
and so passed into history and myth. The term is now used to refer to
any nudge delivered by network wizards over the network that causes bad
things to happen on the system being nudged. For the full story on the
original exploit, see
`http://www.insecure.org/sploits/ping-o-death.html <http://www.insecure.org/sploits/ping-o-death.html>`__.
Compare `*kamikaze packet* <../K/kamikaze-packet.html>`__ and 'Chernobyl
packet.'

 

ping storm
===================

**ping storm**: n.

A form of `*DoS attack* <../D/DoS-attack.html>`__ consisting of a flood
of `*ping* <ping.html>`__ requests (normally used to check network
conditions) designed to disrupt the normal activity of a system. This
act is sometimes called ping lashing or ping flood. Compare `*mail
storm* <../M/mail-storm.html>`__, `*broadcast
storm* <../B/broadcast-storm.html>`__.

 

pink contract
======================

**pink contract**

[spamfighters: from the color of the tinned meat] A contract from an
Internet service provider to a spammer exempting the spammer from the
usual terms of service prohibiting spamming. Usually pink contracts come
about because ISPs can charge the spammer a great deal more than they
would a normal client.

 

pink wire
==============

**pink wire**: n.

[from the pink PTFE wire used in military equipment] As `*blue
wire* <../B/blue-wire.html>`__, but used in military applications.

2. vi. To add a pink wire to a board.

 

pipe
===============

**pipe**: n.

[common] Idiomatically, one's connection to the Internet; in context,
the expansion “bit pipe” is understood. A “fat pipe” is a line with T1
or higher capacity. A person with a 28.8 modem might be heard to
complain “I need a bigger pipe”.

 

pistol
=====================

**pistol**: n.

[IBM] A tool that makes it all too easy for you to shoot yourself in the
foot. “Unix **rm \*** makes such a nice pistol!”

pixel sort
======================

**pixel sort**: n.

[Commodore users] Any compression routine which irretrievably loses
valuable data in the process of `*crunch* <../C/crunch.html>`__\ ing it.
Disparagingly used for ‘lossy’ methods such as JPEG. The theory, of
course, is that these methods are only used on photographic images in
which minor loss-of-data is not visible to the human eye. The term pixel
sort implies distrust of this theory. Compare
`*bogo-sort* <../B/bogo-sort.html>`__.

 

pizza box
===================
 

**pizza box**: n.

[Sun] The largish thin box housing the electronics in (especially Sun)
desktop workstations, so named because of its size and shape and the
dimpled pattern that looks like air holes.

Two-meg single-platter removable disk packs used to be called pizzas,
and the huge drive they were stuck into was referred to as a pizza oven.
It's an index of progress that in the old days just the disk was
pizza-sized, while now the entire computer is.

 

plaid screen
====================

**plaid screen**: n.

[XEROX PARC] A ‘special effect’ that occurs when certain kinds of
`*memory smash* <../M/memory-smash.html>`__\ es overwrite the control
blocks or image memory of a bit-mapped display. The term “salt and
pepper” may refer to a different pattern of similar origin. Though the
term as coined at PARC refers to the result of an error, some of the
`*X* <../X/X.html>`__ demos induce plaid-screen effects deliberately as
a `*display hack* <../D/display-hack.html>`__.

 

plain-ASCII
===============

**plain-ASCII**: /playn·as´kee/

Syn. `*flat-ASCII* <../F/flat-ASCII.html>`__.

 

Plan 9
===========================

**Plan 9**: n.

In the late 1980s, researchers at Bell Labs (especially Rob Pike of
Kernighan & Pike fame) got bored with the limitations of UNIX and
decided to reimplement the entire system. The result was called Plan 9
in “the Bell Labs tradition of selecting names that make marketeers
wince.” The developers also wished to pay homage to the famous film,
“Plan 9 From Outer Space”, considered by some to be the worst movie ever
made. The source is available for download under open-source terms. The
developers and a small fan base hang out at ``comp.os.plan9``, where one
can occasionally hear “If you want UNIX, you know where to find it”

 

plan file
================

**plan file**: n.

[Unix] On systems that support `*finger* <../F/finger.html>`__, the
``.plan`` file in a user's home directory is displayed when the user is
fingered. This feature was originally intended to be used to keep
potential fingerers apprised of one's location and near-future plans,
but has been turned almost universally to humorous and self-expressive
purposes (like a `*sig block* <../S/sig-block.html>`__). See also
`*Hacking X for Y* <../H/Hacking-X-for-Y.html>`__.

A recent innovation in plan files has been the introduction of
“scrolling plan files” which are one-dimensional animations made using
only the printable ASCII character set, carriage return and line feed,
avoiding terminal specific escape sequences, since the
`*finger* <../F/finger.html>`__ command will (for security reasons; see
`*letterbomb* <../L/letterbomb.html>`__) not pass the escape character.

Scrolling .plan files have become art forms in miniature, and some sites
have started competitions to find who can create the longest running,
funniest, and most original animations. Various animation characters
include:

+---------------------------+----------+
| Centipede:                | mmmmme   |
+---------------------------+----------+
| Lorry/Truck:              | oo-oP    |
+---------------------------+----------+
| Andalusian Video Snail:   | \_@/     |
+---------------------------+----------+

and a compiler (ASP) is available on Usenet for producing them. See also
`*twirling baton* <../T/twirling-baton.html>`__.



platinum-iridium
===================

**platinum-iridium**: adj.

Standard, against which all others of the same category are measured.
Usage: silly. The notion is that one of whatever it is has actually been
cast in platinum-iridium alloy and placed in the vault beside the
Standard Kilogram at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
near Paris. (From 1889 to 1960, the meter was defined to be the distance
between two scratches in a platinum-iridium bar kept in that same vault
— this replaced an earlier definition as ``10-7`` times the distance
between the North Pole and the Equator along a meridian through Paris;
unfortunately, this had been based on an inexact value of the
circumference of the Earth. From 1960 to 1984 it was defined to be
1650763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red line of krypton-86 propagating
in a vacuum. It is now defined as the length of the path traveled by
light in a vacuum in the time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. The
kilogram is now the only unit of measure officially defined in terms of
a unique artifact. But this will have to change; in 2003 it was revealed
that the reference kilogram has been shedding mass over time, and is
down by 50 micrograms.) “This garbage-collection algorithm has been
tested against the platinum-iridium cons cell in Paris.” Compare
`*golden* <../G/golden.html>`__.

 

playpen
=========

**playpen**: n.

[IBM] A room where programmers work. Compare `*salt
mines* <../S/salt-mines.html>`__.

 

playte
==========

**playte**: /playt/

16 bits, by analogy with `*nybble* <../N/nybble.html>`__ and
`*byte* <../B/byte.html>`__. Usage: rare and extremely silly. See also
`*dynner* <../D/dynner.html>`__ and `*crumb* <../C/crumb.html>`__.
General discussion of such terms is under
`*nybble* <../N/nybble.html>`__.

plokta
===================

**plokta**: /plok´t@/, v.

[acronym: Press Lots Of Keys To Abort] To press random keys in an
attempt to get some response from the system. One might plokta when the
abort procedure for a program is not known, or when trying to figure out
if the system is just sluggish or really hung. Plokta can also be used
while trying to figure out any unknown key sequence for a particular
operation. Someone going into plokta mode usually places both hands flat
on the keyboard and mashes them down, hoping for some useful response.

A slightly more directed form of plokta can often be seen in mail
messages or Usenet articles from new users — the text might end with

plonk
=======


**plonk**: excl.,vt.

[Usenet: possibly influenced by British slang ‘plonk’ for cheap booze,
or ‘plonker’ for someone behaving stupidly (latter is lit. equivalent to
Yiddish *schmuck*)] The sound a `*newbie* <../N/newbie.html>`__ makes as
he falls to the bottom of a `*kill file* <../K/kill-file.html>`__. While
it originated in the `*newsgroup* <../N/newsgroup.html>`__
``talk.bizarre``, this term (usually written “\*plonk\*”) is now (1994)
widespread on Usenet as a form of public ridicule.
 
plug-and-pray
========================

**plug-and-pray**: adj.,vi.

Parody of the techspeak term plug-and-play, describing a PC peripheral
card which is claimed to have no need for hardware configuration via
jumpers or DIP switches, and which should work as soon as it is inserted
in the PC. Unfortunately, even the PCI bus is all too often not up to
pulling this off reliably, and people who have to do installation or
troubleshoot PCs soon find themselves longing for the jumpers and
switches.

plugh
====================

**plugh**: /ploogh/, v.

[from the `*ADVENT* <../A/ADVENT.html>`__ game] See
`*xyzzy* <../X/xyzzy.html>`__.

 

plumbing
=================

**plumbing**: n.

[Unix] Term used for `*shell* <../S/shell.html>`__ code, so called
because of the prevalence of pipelines that feed the output of one
program to the input of another. Under Unix, user utilities can often be
implemented or at least prototyped by a suitable collection of pipelines
and temp-file grinding encapsulated in a shell script; this is much less
effort than writing C every time, and the capability is considered one
of Unix's major winning features. A few other OSs such as IBM's VM/CMS
support similar facilities. Esp.: used in the construction hairy
plumbing (see `*hairy* <../H/hairy.html>`__). “You can kluge together a
basic spell-checker out of sort(1), comm(1), and tr(1) with a little
plumbing.” See also `*tee* <../T/tee.html>`__.

 
PM
==============

**PM**: /P·M/

1. v. (from preventive maintenance) To bring down a machine for
inspection or test purposes. See `*provocative
maintenance* <provocative-maintenance.html>`__; see also `*scratch
monkey* <../S/scratch-monkey.html>`__.

2. n. Abbrev. for ‘Presentation Manager’, an
`*elephantine* <../E/elephantine.html>`__ OS/2 graphical user interface.

 

P.O.D.
==================

**P.O.D.**: /P·O·D/

[rare; sometimes ‘POD’ without the periods] Acronym for ‘Piece Of Data’
or ‘Plain Old Data’ (as opposed to a code section, or a section
containing mixed code and data). The latter expansion was in use by the
C++ standards committee, for which it indicated a struct or class which
only contains data (as in C), distinguished from one which has a
constructor and member functions. There are things which you can do with
a P.O.D. which you can't with a more general class.

 

point-and-drool interface
========================================

**point-and-drool interface**: n.

Parody of the techspeak term point-and-click interface, describing a
windows, icons, and mouse-based interface such as is found on the
Macintosh. The implication, of course, is that such an interface is only
suitable for idiots. See `*for the rest of
us* <../F/for-the-rest-of-us.html>`__, `*WIMP
environment* <../W/WIMP-environment.html>`__,
`*Macintrash* <../M/Macintrash.html>`__, `*drool-proof
paper* <../D/drool-proof-paper.html>`__. Also point-and-grunt interface.

 

point release
========================

**point release**: n.

[common] A minor release of a software project, especially one intended
to fix bugs or do minor cleanups rather than add features. The term
implies that such releases are relatively frequent, and is generally
used with respect to `*open source* <../O/open-source.html>`__ projects
being developed in `*bazaar* <../B/bazaar.html>`__ mode.
 

pointy-haired
==================

**pointy-haired**: adj.

[after the character in the `*Dilbert* <../D/Dilbert.html>`__ comic
strip] Describes the extreme form of the property that separates
`*suit* <../S/suit.html>`__\ s and
`*marketroid* <../M/marketroid.html>`__\ s from hackers. Compare
`*brain-dead* <../B/brain-dead.html>`__;
`*demented* <../D/demented.html>`__; see `*PHB* <PHB.html>`__. Always
applied to people, never to ideas. The plural form is often used as a
noun. “The pointy-haireds ordered me to use Windows NT, but I set up a
Linux server with Samba instead.”

 

pointy hat
=======================

**pointy hat**: n.

See `*wizard hat* <../W/wizard-hat.html>`__. This synonym specifically
refers to the wizards of Unseen University in Terry Pratchett's
*Discworld* series of humorous fantasies; these books are extremely
popular among hackers.
 

poke
==============

**poke**: n.,vt.

See `*peek* <peek.html>`__.


poll
=======

**poll**: v.,n.

1. [techspeak] The action of checking the status of an input line,
sensor, or memory location to see if a particular external event has
been registered.

2. To repeatedly call or check with someone: “I keep polling him, but
he's not answering his phone; he must be swapped out.”

3. To ask. “Lunch? I poll for a takeout order daily.”


polygon pusher
=================

**polygon pusher**: n.

A chip designer who spends most of his or her time at the physical
layout level (which requires drawing *lots* of multi-colored polygons).
Also rectangle slinger.

POM
=======

**POM**: /P·O·M/, n.

Common abbreviation for `*phase of the
moon* <phase-of-the-moon.html>`__. Usage: usually in the phrase
POM-dependent, which means `*flaky* <../F/flaky.html>`__.


ponytail
===================

**ponytail**: n.

1. A hairstyle in which long hair is held back so as to hang down like a
pony's tail.

2. A descriptive term for a man having a ponytail hairstyle, or such
character traits as might be associated with having a ponytail, eg:
effeminacy, narcissism, undue concern with fashion etc.

3. A general term used by hackers for 'creatives': advertising
copywriters, graphic designers, video compositors, users characterised
by a preference for the Macintosh, recreational drug use, and better sex
lives than programmers.

4. A derogatory term for web designers and other persons peripherally
associated with IT projects, devoid of programming skills and dismissed
as being concerned with visual presentation to the exclusion of actual
technical reality.

pop
==========


**pop**: /pop/

[from the operation that removes the top of a stack, and the fact that
procedure return addresses are usually saved on the stack] (also
capitalized ‘POP’)

1. vt. To remove something from a `*stack* <../S/stack.html>`__. If a
person says he/she has popped something from his stack, that means
he/she has finally finished working on it and can now remove it from the
list of things hanging overhead.

2. When a discussion gets to a level of detail so deep that the main
point of the discussion is being lost, someone will shout “Pop!”,
meaning “Get back up to a higher level!” The shout is frequently
accompanied by an upthrust arm with a finger pointing to the ceiling.

3. [all-caps, as ‘POP’] Point of Presence, a bank of dial-in lines
allowing customers to make (local) calls into an ISP. This is borderline
techspeak.

poser
=======

**poser**: n.

[from French *poseur*] A `*wannabee* <../W/wannabee.html>`__; not hacker
slang, but used among crackers, phreaks and `*warez
d00dz* <../W/warez-d00dz.html>`__. Not as negative as
`*lamer* <../L/lamer.html>`__ or `*leech* <../L/leech.html>`__. Probably
derives from a similar usage among punk-rockers and metalheads, putting
down those who “talk the talk but don't walk the walk”.

postcardware
=============

**postcardware**: n.

A kind of `*shareware* <../S/shareware.html>`__ that borders on
`*freeware* <../F/freeware.html>`__, in that the author requests only
that satisfied users send a postcard of their home town or something.
(This practice, silly as it might seem, serves to remind users that they
are otherwise getting something for nothing, and may also be
psychologically related to real estate ‘sales’ in which $1 changes hands
just to keep the transaction from being a gift.)


Postel's Prescription
======================

**Postel's Prescription**

[proposed] Several of the key Internet `*RFC* <../R/RFC.html>`__\ s,
especially 1122 and 791 contain a piece of advice due to Jon Postel,
which is most often stated as:

    “Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.”

That is, a well-engineered implementation of any of the Internet
protocols should be willing to deal with marginal and imperfectly-formed
inputs, but should not assume that the program on the other end (that
is, the program dealing with the well-engineered implementation's
output) will be anything other than rigid and inflexible, and perhaps
even incomplete or downright buggy.

This property is valuable because a network of programs adhering to it
will be much more robust in the presence of any uncertainties in the
protocol specifications, or any individual implementor's failure to
understand those specifications perfectly. Though the policy does tend
to accommodate broken implementations it is held to more important to
get the communication flowing than to immediately (but terminally)
diagnose the broken implementations at the expense of the people trying
to use them.

The principle is a well-known one in the design of programs that handle
Internet wire protocols, especially network relays and servers, and it
is regularly applied by extension in any situation where two or more
separately-implemented pieces of software are supposed to interoperate
even though the various implementors have never talked to each other and
have absolutely nothing whatsoever in common other than having all read
the same protocol specification. The principle travels under several
different names, including “the Internet credo”, “the IETF maxim”, “the
Internet Engineering Principle”, and “the liberal/conservative rule”;
the [proposed] term “Postel' Prescription” is a tribute to its inventor,
the first RFC editor and (until his untimely death) probably the single
most respected individual in the Internet engineering community.

post
========

**post**: v.

To send a message to a `*mailing list* <../M/mailing-list.html>`__ or
`*newsgroup* <../N/newsgroup.html>`__. Distinguished in context from
mail; one might ask, for example: “Are you going to post the patch or
mail it to known users?”


posting
========

**posting**: n.

Noun corresp. to v.: `*post* <post.html>`__ (but note that
`*post* <post.html>`__ can be nouned). Distinguished from a ‘letter’ or
ordinary `*email* <../E/email.html>`__ message by the fact that it is
broadcast rather than point-to-point. It is not clear whether messages
sent to a small mailing list are postings or email; perhaps the best
dividing line is that if you don't know the names of all the potential
recipients, it is a posting.

postmaster
===========

**postmaster**: n.

The email contact and maintenance person at a site connected to the
network. Often, but not always, the same as the
`*admin* <../A/admin.html>`__. The Internet standard for electronic mail
(`*RFC* <../R/RFC.html>`__-822) requires each machine to have a
‘postmaster’ address; usually it is aliased to this person.

PostScript
=============

**PostScript**: n.

A page description language, based on work originally done by John
Gaffney at Evans and Sutherland in 1976, evolving through ‘JaM’ (‘John
and Martin’, Martin Newell) at `*XEROX PARC* <../X/XEROX-PARC.html>`__,
and finally implemented in its current form by John Warnock et al. after
he and Chuck Geschke founded Adobe Systems Incorporated in 1982.
PostScript gets its leverage by using a full programming language,
rather than a series of low-level escape sequences, to describe an image
to be printed on a laser printer or other output device (in this it
parallels `*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__, which exploited a similar
insight about editing tasks). It is also noteworthy for implementing
on-the fly rasterization, from Bezier curve descriptions, of
high-quality fonts at low (e.g. 300 dpi) resolution (it was formerly
believed that hand-tuned bitmap fonts were required for this task).
Hackers consider PostScript to be among the most elegant hacks of all
time, and the combination of technical merits and widespread
availability has made PostScript the language of choice for graphical
output.


pound on
=========


**pound on**: vt.

Syn. `*bang on* <../B/bang-on.html>`__.

power cycle
=============

**power cycle**: vt.

(also, cycle power or just cycle) To power off a machine and then power
it on immediately, with the intention of clearing some kind of
`*hung* <../H/hung.html>`__ or `*gronk* <../G/gronk.html>`__\ ed state.
See also `*Big Red Switch* <../B/Big-Red-Switch.html>`__. Compare
`*Vulcan nerve pinch* <../V/Vulcan-nerve-pinch.html>`__,
`*bounce* <../B/bounce.html>`__ (sense 4), and
`*boot* <../B/boot.html>`__, and see the `Some AI
Koans <../koans.html>`__ (in Appendix A) about Tom Knight and the
novice.


power hit
===========

**power hit**: n.

A spike or drop-out in the electricity supplying your machine; a power
`*glitch* <../G/glitch.html>`__. These can cause crashes and even
permanent damage to your machine(s).

pr0n
=======

**pr0n**: //

[Usenet, IRC] Pornography. Originally this referred only to Internet
porn but since then it has expanded to refer to just about any kind. The
term comes from the `*warez kiddies* <../W/warez-kiddies.html>`__
tendency to replace letters with numbers. At some point on IRC someone
mistyped, swapping the middle two characters, and the name stuck. It
then propagated over into mainstream hacker usage. New versions of the
Mozilla web browser internally refer to the image library as “libpr0n”.
Compare `*filk* <../F/filk.html>`__, `*grilf* <../G/grilf.html>`__,
`*hing* <../H/hing.html>`__ and `*newsfroup* <../N/newsfroup.html>`__.

precedence lossage
===================

**precedence lossage**: /pre´s@·dens los'@j/, n.

[C programmers] Coding error in an expression due to unexpected grouping
of arithmetic or logical operators by the compiler. Used esp. of certain
common coding errors in C due to the nonintuitively low precedence
levels of **&**, **\|**, **^**, **<<**, and **>>** (for this reason,
experienced C programmers deliberately forget the language's
`*baroque* <../B/baroque.html>`__ precedence hierarchy and parenthesize
defensively). Can always be avoided by suitable use of parentheses.
`*LISP* <../L/LISP.html>`__ fans enjoy pointing out that this can't
happen in *their* favorite language, which eschews precedence entirely,
requiring one to use explicit parentheses everywhere. See `*aliasing
bug* <../A/aliasing-bug.html>`__, `*memory
leak* <../M/memory-leak.html>`__, `*memory
smash* <../M/memory-smash.html>`__, `*smash the
stack* <../S/smash-the-stack.html>`__, `*fandango on
core* <../F/fandango-on-core.html>`__, `*overrun
screw* <../O/overrun-screw.html>`__.

pred
=======

**pred**: //

[Usenet; orig. fr. the Island MUD via Oxford University] Abbreviation
for “predictable”, used to signify or preempt responses that are
extremely predictable but have to be filled in for the sake of form (the
phrase is bracketed by <pred>...</pred>). X-Pred headers in mail or news
serve the same end. Figuring out the connection between the X-Pred
tagline and the thread is part of the entertainment. For example, it is
said that any thread about taxation must contain a reference to Raquel
Welch, if only to stop other people from mentioning her. This is
allegedly due to a Monty Python sketch where a character declares that
he would tax Raquel Welch, and he has a feeling she would tax him.

prepend
=============



**prepend**: /pree\`pend´/, vt.

[by analogy with ‘append’] To prefix. As with ‘append’ (but not ‘prefix’
or ‘suffix’ as a verb), the direct object is always the thing being
added and not the original word (or character string, or whatever). “If
you prepend a semicolon to the line, the translation routine will pass
it through unaltered.”


prestidigitization
===================

**prestidigitization**: /pres\`t@·di\`j@·ti:·zay´sh@n/, n.

1. The act of putting something into digital notation via sleight of
hand.

2. Data entry through legerdemain.

pretty pictures
====================

**pretty pictures**: n.

[scientific computation] The next step up from
`*numbers* <../N/numbers.html>`__. Interesting graphical output from a
program that may not have any sensible relationship to the system the
program is intended to model. Good for showing to
`*management* <../M/management.html>`__.

prettyprint
=============

**prettyprint**: /prit´ee·print/, v.

(alt.: pretty-print)

1. To generate ‘pretty’ human-readable output from a
`*hairy* <../H/hairy.html>`__ internal representation; esp. used for the
process of `*grind* <../G/grind.html>`__\ ing (sense 1) program code,
and most esp. for LISP code.

2. To format in some particularly slick and nontrivial way.

pretzel key
==============

**pretzel key**: n.

[Mac users] See `*feature key* <../F/feature-key.html>`__.


priesthood
=============

**priesthood**: n.

[TMRC; obs.] The select group of system managers responsible for the
operation and maintenance of a batch computer system. On these
computers, a user never had direct access to a computer, but had to
submit his/her data and programs to a priest for execution. Results were
returned days or even weeks later.

prime time
================

**prime time**: n.

[from TV programming] Normal high-usage hours on a system or network.
Back in the days of big timesharing machines ‘prime time’ was when lots
of people were competing for limited cycles, usually the day shift.
Avoidance of prime time was traditionally given as a major reason for
`*night mode* <../N/night-mode.html>`__ hacking. The term fell into
disuse during the early PC era, but has been revived to refer to times
of day or evening at which the Internet tends to be heavily loaded,
making Web access slow. The hackish tendency to late-night `*hacking
run* <../H/hacking-run.html>`__\ s has changed not a bit.

print
========

**print**: v.

To output, even if to a screen. If a hacker says that a program “printed
a message”, he means this; if he refers to printing a file, he probably
means it in the conventional sense of writing to a hardcopy device
(compounds like ‘print job’ and ‘printout’, on the other hand, always
refer to the latter). This very common term is likely a holdover from
the days when printing terminals were the norm, perpetuated by
programming language constructs like `*C* <../C/C.html>`__'s printf(3).
See senses 1 and 2 of `*tty* <../T/tty.html>`__.

printing discussion
====================

**printing discussion**: n.

[XEROX PARC] A protracted, low-level, time-consuming, generally
pointless discussion of something only peripherally interesting to all.


priority interrupt
===================

**priority interrupt**: n.

[from the hardware term] Describes any stimulus compelling enough to
yank one right out of `*hack mode* <../H/hack-mode.html>`__. Classically
used to describe being dragged away by an `*SO* <../S/SO.html>`__ for
immediate sex, but may also refer to more mundane interruptions such as
a fire alarm going off in the near vicinity. Also called an
`*NMI* <../N/NMI.html>`__ (non-maskable interrupt), especially in
PC-land.

profile
===========

**profile**: n.

1. A control file for a program, esp. a text file automatically read
from each user's home directory and intended to be easily modified by
the user in order to customize the program's behavior. Used to avoid
`*hardcoded* <../H/hardcoded.html>`__ choices (see also `*dot
file* <../D/dot-file.html>`__, `*rc file* <../R/rc-file.html>`__).

2. [techspeak] A report on the amounts of time spent in each routine of
a program, used to find and `*tune* <../T/tune.html>`__ away the `*hot
spot* <../H/hot-spot.html>`__\ s in it. This sense is often verbed. Some
profiling modes report units other than time (such as call counts)
and/or report at granularities other than per-routine, but the idea is
similar. 3.[techspeak] A subset of a standard used for a particular
purpose. This sense confuses hackers who wander into the weird world of
ISO standards no end!

progasm
===============

**progasm**: /proh´gaz·m/, n.

[University of Wisconsin] The euphoria experienced upon the completion
of a program or other computer-related project. For example, the rush
you get when you finally run the code you've been hacking for the past
week and it works first time. (The quality of the experience is directly
proportional to the complexity of the code and inversely proportional to
the amount of debugging it took to get the code working.) Compare
`*geekasm* <../G/geekasm.html>`__.

proggy
========

**proggy**: n.

1. Any computer program that is considered a full application.

2. Any computer program that is made up of or otherwise contains
`*proglet* <proglet.html>`__\ s.

3. Any computer program that is large enough to be normally distributed
as an RPM or `*tarball* <../T/tarball.html>`__.


proglet
=========

**proglet**: /prog´let/, n.

[UK] A short *extempore* program written to meet an immediate, transient
need. Often written in BASIC, rarely more than a dozen lines long, and
containing no subroutines. The largest amount of code that can be
written off the top of one's head, that does not need any editing, and
that runs correctly the first time (this amount varies significantly
according to one's skill and the language one is using). Compare `*toy
program* <../T/toy-program.html>`__, `*noddy* <../N/noddy.html>`__,
`*one-liner wars* <../O/one-liner-wars.html>`__.

program
========

**program**: n.

1. A magic spell cast over a computer allowing it to turn one's input
into error messages.

2. An exercise in experimental epistemology.

3. A form of art, ostensibly intended for the instruction of computers,
which is nevertheless almost inevitably a failure if other programmers
can't understand it.

Programmer's Cheer
=====================

**Programmer's Cheer**

“Shift to the left! Shift to the right! Pop up, push down! Byte! Byte!
Byte!” A joke so old it has hair on it.

programming fluid
===================


**programming fluid**: n.

1. Coffee.

2. Cola.

3. Any caffeinacious stimulant. Many hackers consider these essential
for those all-night hacking runs. See
`*wirewater* <../W/wirewater.html>`__.

programming
================

**programming**: n.

1. The art of debugging a blank sheet of paper (or, in these days of
on-line editing, the art of debugging an empty file). “Bloody
instructions which, being taught, return to plague their inventor”
(*Macbeth*, Act 1, Scene 7)

2. A pastime similar to banging one's head against a wall, but with
fewer opportunities for reward.

3. The most fun you can have with your clothes on.

4. The least fun you can have with your clothes off.

propeller head
==================

**propeller head**: n.

Used by hackers, this is syn. with `*geek* <../G/geek.html>`__.
Non-hackers sometimes use it to describe all techies. Prob. derives from
SF fandom's tradition (originally invented by old-time fan Ray Faraday
Nelson) of propeller beanies as fannish insignia (though nobody actually
wears them except as a joke).

propeller key
=================

**propeller key**: n.

[Mac users] See `*feature key* <../F/feature-key.html>`__.

proprietary
=============

**proprietary**: adj.

1. In `*marketroid* <../M/marketroid.html>`__-speak, superior; implies a
product imbued with exclusive magic by the unmatched brilliance of the
company's own hardware or software designers.

2. In the language of hackers and users, inferior; implies a product not
conforming to open-systems standards, and thus one that puts the
customer at the mercy of a vendor able to gouge freely on service and
upgrade charges after the initial sale has locked the customer in. Often
used in the phrase “proprietary crap”.

3. Synonym for closed-source or non-free, e.g. software issued without
license rights permitting the public to independently review, develop
and redistribute it.

Proprietary software should be distinguished from commercial software.
It is possible for software to be commercial (that is, intended to make
a profit for the producers) without being proprietary. The reverse is
also possible, for example in binary-only freeware.

protocol
==========

**protocol**: n.

As used by hackers, this never refers to niceties about the proper form
for addressing letters to the Papal Nuncio or the order in which one
should use the forks in a Russian-style place setting; hackers don't
care about such things. It is used instead to describe any set of rules
that allow different machines or pieces of software to coordinate with
each other without ambiguity. So, for example, it does include niceties
about the proper form for addressing packets on a network or the order
in which one should use the forks in the Dining Philosophers Problem. It
implies that there is some common message format and an accepted set of
primitives or commands that all parties involved understand, and that
transactions among them follow predictable logical sequences. See also
`*handshaking* <../H/handshaking.html>`__, `*do
protocol* <../D/do-protocol.html>`__.

provocative maintenance
==========================

**provocative maintenance**: n.

[common ironic mutation of preventive maintenance] Actions performed
upon a machine at regularly scheduled intervals to ensure that the
system remains in a usable state. So called because it is all too often
performed by a `*field servoid* <../F/field-servoid.html>`__ who doesn't
know what he is doing; such ‘maintenance’ often *induces* problems, or
otherwise results in the machine's remaining in an *un*\ usable state
for an indeterminate amount of time. See also `*scratch
monkey* <../S/scratch-monkey.html>`__.

prowler
===========

**prowler**: n.

[Unix] A `*daemon* <../D/daemon.html>`__ that is run periodically
(typically once a week) to seek out and erase
`*core* <../C/core.html>`__ files, truncate administrative logfiles,
nuke **lost+found** directories, and otherwise clean up the
`*cruft* <../C/cruft.html>`__ that tends to pile up in the corners of a
file system. See also `*reaper* <../R/reaper.html>`__,
`*skulker* <../S/skulker.html>`__.

pseudo
========

**pseudo**: /soo´doh/, n.

[Usenet: truncation of ‘pseudonym’]

1. An electronic-mail or `*Usenet* <../U/Usenet.html>`__ persona adopted
by a human for amusement value or as a means of avoiding negative
repercussions of one's net.behavior; a ‘nom de Usenet’, often associated
with forged postings designed to conceal message origins. Perhaps the
best-known and funniest hoax of this type is
`*B1FF* <../B/B1FF.html>`__. See also
`*tentacle* <../T/tentacle.html>`__.

2. Notionally, a `*flamage* <../F/flamage.html>`__-generating AI program
simulating a Usenet user. Many flamers have been accused of actually
being such entities, despite the fact that no AI program of the required
sophistication yet exists. However, in 1989 there was a famous series of
forged postings that used a phrase-frequency-based travesty generator to
simulate the styles of several well-known flamers; it was based on large
samples of their back postings (compare `*Dissociated
Press* <../D/Dissociated-Press.html>`__). A significant number of people
were fooled by the forgeries, and the debate over their authenticity was
settled only when the perpetrator came forward to publicly admit the
hoax.

pseudoprime
===============

**pseudoprime**: n.

A backgammon prime (six consecutive occupied points) with one point
missing. This term is an esoteric pun derived from number theory: a
number that passes a certain kind of “primality test” may be called a
pseudoprime (all primes pass any such test, but so do some composite
numbers), and any number that passes several is, in some sense, almost
certainly prime. The hacker backgammon usage stems from the idea that a
pseudoprime is almost as good as a prime: it will do the same job unless
you are unlucky.



pseudosuit
==============

**pseudosuit**: /soo´doh·s[y]oot\`/, n.

A `*suit* <../S/suit.html>`__ wannabee; a hacker who has decided that he
wants to be in management or administration and begins wearing ties,
sport coats, and (shudder!) suits voluntarily. It's his funeral. See
also `*lobotomy* <../L/lobotomy.html>`__.


psychedelicware
=================

**psychedelicware**: /si:\`k@·del'·ik·weir/, n.

[UK] Syn. `*display hack* <../D/display-hack.html>`__. See also
`*smoking clover* <../S/smoking-clover.html>`__.

psyton
===============

**psyton**: /si:´ton/, n.

[TMRC] The elementary particle carrying the sinister force. The
probability of a process losing is proportional to the number of psytons
falling on it. Psytons are generated by observers, which is why demos
are more likely to fail when lots of people are watching. [This term
appears to have been largely superseded by
`*bogon* <../B/bogon.html>`__; see also `*quantum
bogodynamics* <../Q/quantum-bogodynamics.html>`__. —ESR]

pubic directory
=================

**pubic directory**: /pyoob´ik d@·rek´t@·ree/, n.

[NYU] (also pube directory /pyoob' d@·rek´t@·ree/) The pub (public)
directory on a machine that allows FTP access. So called because it is
the default location for `*SEX* <../S/SEX.html>`__ (sense 1). “I'll have
the source in the pube directory by Friday.”

puff
=========

**puff**: vt.

To decompress data that has been crunched by Huffman coding. At least
one widely distributed Huffman decoder program was actually *named*
‘PUFF’, but these days it is usually packaged with the encoder. Oppose
`*huff* <../H/huff.html>`__, see `*inflate* <../I/inflate.html>`__.

pumpking
=============

**pumpking**: n.

Syn. for `*pumpkin holder* <pumpkin-holder.html>`__; see `*patch
pumpkin* <patch-pumpkin.html>`__.

pumpkin holder
=================

**pumpkin holder**: n.

See `*patch pumpkin* <patch-pumpkin.html>`__.

punched card
================

**punched card**:

[techspeak] (alt.: punch card) The signature medium of computing's
`*Stone Age* <../S/Stone-Age.html>`__, now obsolescent. The punched card
actually predated computers considerably, originating in 1801 as a
control device for mechanical looms. The version patented by Hollerith
and used with mechanical tabulating machines in the 1890 U.S. Census was
a piece of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm. There is a widespread myth
that it was designed to fit in the currency trays used for that era's
larger dollar bills, but recent investigations have falsified this.

IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married the
punched card to computers, encoding binary information as patterns of
small rectangular holes; one character per column, 80 columns per card.
Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and hole shapes were tried at
various times.

The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the IBM
punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards distributed
with many varieties of computers even today. See
`*chad* <../C/chad.html>`__, `*chad box* <../C/chad-box.html>`__,
`*eighty-column mind* <../E/eighty-column-mind.html>`__, `*green
card* <../G/green-card.html>`__, `*dusty
deck* <../D/dusty-deck.html>`__, `*code
grinder* <../C/code-grinder.html>`__.

punt
===========

**punt**: v.

[from the punch line of an old joke referring to American football:
“Drop back 15 yards and punt!”]

1. To give up, typically without any intention of retrying. “Let's punt
the movie tonight.” “I was going to hack all night to get this feature
in, but I decided to punt” may mean that you've decided not to stay up
all night, and may also mean you're not ever even going to put in the
feature.

2. More specifically, to give up on figuring out what the `*Right
Thing* <../R/Right-Thing.html>`__ is and resort to an inefficient hack.

3. A design decision to defer solving a problem, typically because one
cannot define what is desirable sufficiently well to frame an
algorithmic solution. “No way to know what the right form to dump the
graph in is — we'll punt that for now.”

4. To hand a tricky implementation problem off to some other section of
the design. “It's too hard to get the compiler to do that; let's punt to
the runtime system.”

5. To knock someone off an Internet or chat connection; a punter thus,
is a person or program that does this.

Purple Book
===============

**Purple Book**: n.

1. The *System V Interface Definition*. The covers of the first editions
were an amazingly nauseating shade of off-lavender.

2. Syn. `*Wizard Book* <../W/Wizard-Book.html>`__. Donald Lewine's
*POSIX Programmer's Guide* (O'Reilly, 1991, ISBN 0-937175-73-0). See
also `*book titles* <../B/book-titles.html>`__.


purple wire
=================

**purple wire**: n.

[IBM] Wire installed by Field Engineers to work around problems
discovered during testing or debugging. These are called ‘purple wires’
even when (as is frequently the case) their actual physical color is
yellow.... Compare `*blue wire* <../B/blue-wire.html>`__, `*yellow
wire* <../Y/yellow-wire.html>`__, and `*red
wire* <../R/red-wire.html>`__.

push
==========

**push**

[from the operation that puts the current information on a stack, and
the fact that procedure return addresses are saved on a stack] (Also
PUSH /push/ or PUSHJ /push´J/, the latter based on the PDP-10 procedure
call instruction.)

1. To put something onto a `*stack* <../S/stack.html>`__. If one says
that something has been pushed onto one's stack, it means that the
Damoclean list of things hanging over ones's head has grown longer and
heavier yet. This may also imply that one will deal with it *before*
other pending items; otherwise one might say that the thing was ‘added
to my queue’.

2. vi. To enter upon a digression, to save the current discussion for
later. Antonym of `*pop* <pop.html>`__; see also
`*stack* <../S/stack.html>`__.

Python
==========

**Python**: /pi:´thon/

In the words of its author, “the other scripting language” (other than
`*Perl* <Perl.html>`__, that is). Python's design is notably clean,
elegant, and well thought through; it tends to attract the sort of
programmers who find Perl grubby and exiguous. Some people revolt at its
use of whitespace to define logical structure by indentation, objecting
that this harks back to the horrible old fixed-field languages of the
1960s. Python's relationship with Perl is rather like the
`*BSD* <../B/BSD.html>`__ community's relationship to
`*Linux* <../L/Linux.html>`__ — it's the smaller party in a (usually
friendly) rivalry, but the average quality of its developers is
generally conceded to be rather higher than in the larger community it
competes with. There's a Python resource page at
`http://www.python.org <http://www.python.org>`__. See also
`*Guido* <../G/Guido.html>`__, `*BDFL* <../B/BDFL.html>`__.
