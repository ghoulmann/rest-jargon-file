Little lapses of attention or (in more severe cases) consciousness,

hacking. “I need to go home and crash; I'm starting to get a lot of

correctable transient error in memory hardware. It predates RAM; in
fact, this term is reported to have already have been in use in its
jargon sense back in the 1960s when magnetic cores ruled. Parity errors
can also afflict mass storage and serial communication lines; this is
more serious because not always correctable.

**Parkinson's Law of Data**: prov.

“Data expands to fill the space available for storage”; buying more
memory encourages the use of more memory-intensive techniques. (The
original 1958 Parkinson's Law described the structural tendency of
bureaucracies to make work for themselves.) It has been observed since
the mid-1980s that the memory usage of evolving systems tends to double
roughly once every 18 months. Fortunately, memory density available for
constant dollars also tends to about double once every 18 months (see
`*Moore's Law* <../M/Moores-Law.html>`__); unfortunately, the laws of
physics guarantee that the latter cannot continue indefinitely.

**parse**: vt.

1. To determine the syntactic structure of a sentence or other utterance

“I can't parse that.”

2. More generally, to understand or comprehend. “It's very simple; you
just kretch the glims and then aos the zotz.” “I can't parse that.”

3. Of fish, to have to remove the bones yourself. “I object to parsing
fish”, means “I don't want to get a whole fish, but a sliced one is
okay”. A parsed fish has been deboned. There is some controversy over
whether unparsed should mean ‘bony’, or also mean ‘deboned’.

**PascalCasing**

The practice of marking all word boundaries in long identifiers (such as
ThisIsASampleVariable) (including the first letter of the identifier)
with uppercase. Constrasts with camelCasing, in which the first
character of the identifier is left in lowercase
(thisIsASampleVariable), and with the traditional C style of short
all-lower-case names with internal word breaks marked by an underscore
(sample\_var).

Where these terms are used, they usually go with advice to use
PascalCasing for public interfaces and camelCasing for private ones.
They may have originated at Microsoft, but are in more general use in
ECMA standards, among Java programmers, and elsewhere.

Pascal

`Prev <parse.html>`__ 

P

 `Next <PascalCasing.html>`__

--------------

**Pascal**: n.

An Algol-descended language designed by Niklaus Wirth on the CDC 6600
around 1967--68 as an instructional tool for elementary programming.
This language, designed primarily to keep students from shooting
themselves in the foot and thus extremely restrictive from a
general-purpose-programming point of view, was later promoted as a
general-purpose tool and, in fact, became the ancestor of a large family
of languages including Modula-2 and Ada (see also
`*bondage-and-discipline
language* <../B/bondage-and-discipline-language.html>`__). The hackish
point of view on Pascal was probably best summed up by a devastating
(and, in its deadpan way, screamingly funny) 1981 paper by Brian
Kernighan (of `*K&R* <../K/K-ampersand-R.html>`__ fame) entitled *Why
Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language*, which was turned down
by the technical journals but circulated widely via photocopies. It was
eventually published in *Comparing and Assessing Programming Languages*,
edited by Alan Feuer and Narain Gehani (Prentice-Hall, 1984). Part of
his discussion is worth repeating here, because its criticisms are still
apposite to Pascal itself after many years of improvement and could also
stand as an indictment of many other bondage-and-discipline languages.
(The entire essay is available at
`http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html <http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html>`__.)
At the end of a summary of the case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote:

    9. There is no escape

    This last point is perhaps the most important. The language is
    inadequate but circumscribed, because there is no way to escape its
    limitations. There are no casts to disable the type-checking when
    necessary. There is no way to replace the defective run-time
    environment with a sensible one, unless one controls the compiler
    that defines the “standard procedures”. The language is closed.

    People who use Pascal for serious programming fall into a fatal
    trap. Because the language is impotent, it must be extended. But
    each group extends Pascal in its own direction, to make it look like
    whatever language they really want. Extensions for separate
    compilation, FORTRAN-like COMMON, string data types, internal static
    variables, initialization, octal numbers, bit operators, etc., all
    add to the utility of the language for one group but destroy its
    portability to others.

    I feel that it is a mistake to use Pascal for anything much beyond
    its original target. In its pure form, Pascal is a toy language,
    suitable for teaching but not for real programming.

Pascal has since been entirely displaced (mainly by
`*C* <../C/C.html>`__) from the niches it had acquired in serious
applications and systems programming, and from its role as a teaching
language by Java.

**pastie**: /pay´stee/, n.

An adhesive-backed label designed to be attached to a key on a keyboard
to indicate some non-standard character which can be accessed through
that key. Pasties are likely to be used in APL environments, where
almost every key is associated with a special character. A pastie on the
R key, for example, might remind the user that it is used to generate
the ρ character. The term properly refers to nipple-concealing devices
formerly worn by strippers in concession to indecent-exposure laws;

**patch**

1. n. A temporary addition to a piece of code, usually as a
`*quick-and-dirty* <../Q/quick-and-dirty.html>`__ remedy to an existing
bug or misfeature. A patch may or may not work, and may or may not
eventually be incorporated permanently into the program. Distinguished
from a `*diff* <../D/diff.html>`__ or `*mod* <../M/mod.html>`__ by the
fact that a patch is generated by more primitive means than the rest of
the program; the classical examples are instructions modified by using
the front panel switches, and changes made directly to the binary
executable of a program originally written in an
`*HLL* <../H/HLL.html>`__. Compare `*one-line
fix* <../O/one-line-fix.html>`__.

2. vt. To insert a patch into a piece of code.

3. [in the Unix world] n. A `*diff* <../D/diff.html>`__ (sense 2).

4. A set of modifications to binaries to be applied by a patching
program. IBM operating systems often receive updates to the operating
system in the form of absolute hexadecimal patches. If you have modified
your OS, you have to disassemble these back to the source. The patches
might later be corrected by other patches on top of them (patches were
said to “grow scar tissue”). The result was often a convoluted `*patch
space* <patch-space.html>`__ and headaches galore.

5. [Unix] the patch(1) program, written by Larry Wall, which
automatically applies a patch (sense 3) to a set of source code.

There is a classic story of a `*tiger team* <../T/tiger-team.html>`__
penetrating a secure military computer that illustrates the danger
inherent in binary patches (or, indeed, any patches that you can't — or
don't — inspect and examine before installing). They couldn't find any
`*trap door* <../T/trap-door.html>`__\ s or any way to penetrate
security of IBM's OS, so they made a site visit to an IBM office
(remember, these were official military types who were purportedly on
official business), swiped some IBM stationery, and created a fake
patch. The patch was actually the trapdoor they needed. The patch was
distributed at about the right time for an IBM patch, had official
stationery and all accompanying documentation, and was dutifully
installed. The installation manager very shortly thereafter learned
something about proper procedures.

**patch pumpkin**: n.

[Perl hackers] A notional token passed around among the members of a

authority to make changes on the project's master source tree. The
implicit assumption is that pumpkin holder status is temporary and
rotates periodically among senior project members.

This term comes from the Perl development community, but has been
sighted elsewhere. It derives from a stuffed-toy pumpkin that was passed
around at a development shop years ago as the access control for a
shared backup-tape drive.

2. [Unix] A filename, fully specified relative to the root directory (as
opposed to relative to the current directory; the latter is sometimes
called a relative path). This is also called a pathname.

3. [Unix and MS-DOS/Windows] The search path, an environment variable
specifying the directories in which the `*shell* <../S/shell.html>`__
(COMMAND.COM, under MS-DOS) should look for commands. Other, similar

**pathological**: adj.

1. [scientific computation] Used of a data set that is grossly atypical
of normal expected input, esp. one that exposes a weakness or bug in
whatever algorithm one is using. An algorithm that can be broken by
pathological inputs may still be useful if such inputs are very unlikely
to occur in practice.

2. When used of test input, implies that it was purposefully engineered
as a worst case. The implication in both senses is that the data is
spectacularly ill-conditioned or that someone had to explicitly set out
to break the algorithm in order to come up with such a crazy example.

3. Also said of an unlikely collection of circumstances. “If the network
is down and comes up halfway through the execution of that command by
root, the system may just crash.” “Yes, but that's a pathological case.”
Often used to dismiss the case from discussion, with the implication
that the consequences are acceptable, since they will happen so
infrequently (if at all) that it doesn't seem worth going to the extra
trouble to handle that case (see sense 1).

**PDP-10**: n.

[Programmed Data Processor model 10] The machine that made
`*timesharing* <../T/timesharing.html>`__ real. It looms large in hacker
folklore because of its adoption in the mid-1970s by many university
computing facilities and research labs, including the MIT AI Lab,
Stanford, and CMU. Some aspects of the instruction set (most notably the
bit-field instructions) are still considered unsurpassed. The 10 was
eventually eclipsed by the `*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__ machines
(descendants of the `*PDP-11* <PDP-11.html>`__) when
`*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__ recognized that the 10 and
`*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__ product lines were competing with each other
and decided to concentrate its software development effort on the more
profitable `*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__. The machine was finally dropped
from DEC's line in 1983, following the failure of the Jupiter Project at
DEC to build a viable new model. (Some attempts by other companies to
market clones came to nothing; see `*Foonly* <../F/Foonly.html>`__ and
`*Mars* <../M/Mars.html>`__.) This event spelled the doom of
`*ITS* <../I/ITS.html>`__ and the technical cultures that had spawned
the original Jargon File, but by mid-1991 it had become something of a
badge of honorable old-timerhood among hackers to have cut one's teeth
on a PDP-10. See `*TOPS-10* <../T/TOPS-10.html>`__,

**PDP-11**

Possibly the single most successful minicomputer design in history, a
favorite of hackers for many years, and the first major Unix machine,
The first PDP-11s (the 11/15 and 11/20) shipped in 1970 from
`*DEC* <../D/DEC.html>`__; the last (11/93 and 11/94) in 1990. Along the
way, the 11 gave birth to the `*VAX* <../V/VAX.html>`__, strongly
influenced the design of microprocessors such as the Motorola 6800 and
Intel 386, and left a permanent imprint on the C language (which has an
odd preference for octal embedded in its syntax because of the way
PDP-11 machine instructions were formatted). There is a `history
site <http://telnet.hu/hamster/pdp-11/>`__.

The most famous computer that never was. `*PDP-10* <PDP-10.html>`__
computers running the `*TOPS-10* <../T/TOPS-10.html>`__ operating system
were labeled ‘DECsystem-10’ as a way of differentiating them from the
`*PDP-11* <PDP-11.html>`__. Later on, those systems running
`*TOPS-20* <../T/TOPS-20.html>`__ were labeled ‘DECSYSTEM-20’ (the block
capitals being the result of a lawsuit brought against DEC by Singer,
which once made a computer called ‘system-10’), but contrary to popular
lore there was never a ‘PDP-20’; the only difference between a 10 and a
20 was the operating system and the color of the paint. Most (but not
all) machines sold to run TOPS-10 were painted ‘Basil Blue’, whereas
most TOPS-20 machines were painted ‘Chinese Red’ (often mistakenly
called orange).

**peek**: n.,vt.

(and `*poke* <poke.html>`__) The commands in most microcomputer BASICs
for directly accessing memory contents at an absolute address; often
extended to mean the corresponding constructs in any
`*HLL* <../H/HLL.html>`__ (peek reads memory, poke modifies it). Much
hacking on small, non-MMU micros used to consist of peeking around
memory, more or less at random, to find the location where the system
keeps interesting stuff. Long (and variably accurate) lists of such
addresses for various computers circulated. The results of pokes at
these addresses may be highly useful, mildly amusing, useless but neat,
or (most likely) total `*lossage* <../L/lossage.html>`__ (see `*killer
poke* <../K/killer-poke.html>`__).

Since a `*real operating system* <../R/real-operating-system.html>`__
provides useful, higher-level services for the tasks commonly performed
with peeks and pokes on micros, and real languages tend not to encourage
low-level memory groveling, a question like “How do I do a peek in C?”
is diagnostic of the `*newbie* <../N/newbie.html>`__. (Of course, OS
kernels often have to do exactly this; a real kernel hacker would
unhesitatingly, if unportably, assign an absolute address to a pointer
variable and indirect through it.)

**pencil and paper**: n.

An archaic information storage and transmission device that works by
depositing smears of graphite on bleached wood pulp. More recent
developments in paper-based technology include improved ‘write-once’
update devices which use tiny rolling heads similar to mouse balls to
deposit colored pigment. All these devices require an operator skilled
at so-called ‘handwriting’ technique. These technologies are ubiquitous
outside hackerdom, but nearly forgotten inside it. Most hackers had
terrible handwriting to begin with, and years of keyboarding tend to
have encouraged it to degrade further. Perhaps for this reason, hackers
deprecate pencil-and-paper technology and often resist using it in any
but the most trivial contexts.

--------------

**Pentium**: n.

The name given to Intel's P5 chip, the successor to the 80486. The name
was chosen because of difficulties Intel had in trademarking a number.
It suggests the number five (implying 586) while (according to Intel)
conveying a meaning of strength “like titanium”. Among hackers, the
plural is frequently ‘pentia’. See also `*Pentagram
Pro* <Pentagram-Pro.html>`__.

Intel did not stick to this convention when naming its P6 processor the
Pentium Pro; many believe this is due to difficulties in selling a chip
with “hex” or “sex” in its name. Successor chips have been called
Pentium II, Pentium III, and Pentium IV.

going to `*wrap around* <../W/wrap-around.html>`__ to the day schedule
by Friday.” A person who is roughly 12 hours out of phase is sometimes
said to be in night mode. (The term day mode is also (but less
frequently) used, meaning you're working 9 to 5 (or, more likely, 10 to
6).) The act of altering one's cycle is called changing phase; phase
shifting has also been recently reported from Caltech.

2. change phase the hard way: To stay awake for a very long time in
order to get into a different phase.

3. change phase the easy way: To stay asleep, etc. However, some claim
that either staying awake longer or sleeping longer is easy, and that it
is *shortening* your day or night that is really hard (see `*wrap
around* <../W/wrap-around.html>`__). The ‘jet lag’ that afflicts
travelers who cross many time-zone boundaries may be attributed to two
distinct causes: the strain of travel per se, and the strain of changing
phase. Hackers who suddenly find that they must change phase drastically
in a short period of time, particularly the hard way, experience
something very like jet lag without traveling.

**phase of the moon**: n.

Used humorously as a random parameter on which something is said to
depend. Sometimes implies unreliability of whatever is dependent, or
that reliability seems to be dependent on conditions nobody has been
able to determine. “This feature depends on having the channel open in
mumble mode, having the foo switch set, and on the phase of the moon.”
See also `*heisenbug* <../H/heisenbug.html>`__.

True story: Once upon a time there was a program bug that really did
depend on the phase of the moon. There was a little subroutine that had
traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an
approximation to the moon's true phase. GLS incorporated this routine
into a LISP program that, when it wrote out a file, would print a
timestamp line almost 80 characters long. Very occasionally the first
line of the message would be too long and would overflow onto the next
line, and when the file was later read back in the program would
`*barf* <../B/barf.html>`__. The length of the first line depended on
both the precise date and time and the length of the phase specification
when the timestamp was printed, and so the bug literally depended on the
phase of the moon!

The first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983) included an
example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug, but the
typesetter ‘corrected’ it. This has since been described as the
phase-of-the-moon-bug bug.

However, beware of assumptions. A few years ago, engineers of CERN
(European Center for Nuclear Research) were baffled by some errors in
experiments conducted with the LEP particle accelerator. As the
formidable amount of data generated by such devices is heavily processed
by computers before being seen by humans, many people suggested the
software was somehow sensitive to the phase of the moon. A few desperate
engineers discovered the truth; the error turned out to be the result of
a tiny change in the geometry of the 27km circumference ring, physically
caused by the deformation of the Earth by the passage of the Moon! This
story has entered physics folklore as a Newtonian vengeance on particle
physics and as an example of the relevance of the simplest and oldest
physical laws to the most modern science.

**phreaking**: /freek´ing/, n.

[from ‘phone phreak’]

1. The art and science of `*cracking* <../C/cracking.html>`__ the phone
network (so as, for example, to make free long-distance calls).

2. By extension, security-cracking in any other context (especially, but
not exclusively, on communications networks) (see
`*cracking* <../C/cracking.html>`__).

At one time phreaking was a semi-respectable activity among hackers;
there was a gentleman's agreement that phreaking as an intellectual game
and a form of exploration was OK, but serious theft of services was
taboo. There was significant crossover between the hacker community and
the hard-core phone phreaks who ran semi-underground networks of their
own through such media as the legendary *TAP Newsletter*. This ethos
began to break down in the mid-1980s as wider dissemination of the
techniques put them in the hands of less responsible phreaks. Around the
same time, changes in the phone network made old-style technical
ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it, so phreaking came to
depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phone-card
numbers. The crimes and punishments of gangs like the ‘414 group’ turned
that game very ugly. A few old-time hackers still phreak casually just
to keep their hand in, but most these days have hardly even heard of
‘blue boxes’ or any of the other paraphernalia of the great phreaks of
yore.

**ping**

[from the submariners' term for a sonar pulse]

1. n. Slang term for a small network message (ICMP ECHO) sent by a
computer to check for the presence and alertness of another. The Unix
command ping(8) can be used to do this manually (note that ping(8)'s
author denies the widespread folk etymology that the name was ever
intended as an acronym for ‘Packet INternet Groper’). Occasionally used
as a phone greeting. See `*ACK* <../A/ACK.html>`__, also
`*ENQ* <../E/ENQ.html>`__.

2. vt. To verify the presence of.

3. vt. To get the attention of.

4. vt. To send a message to all members of a `*mailing
list* <../M/mailing-list.html>`__ requesting an
`*ACK* <../A/ACK.html>`__ (in order to verify that everybody's addresses
are reachable). “We haven't heard much of anything from Geoff, but he
did respond with an ACK both times I pinged jargon-friends.”

5. n. A quantum packet of happiness. People who are very happy tend to
exude pings; furthermore, one can intentionally create pings and aim
them at a needy party (e.g., a depressed person). This sense of ping may
appear as an exclamation; “Ping!” (I'm happy; I am emitting a quantum of
happiness; I have been struck by a quantum of happiness). The form
“pingfulness”, which is used to describe people who exude pings, also
occurs. (In the standard abuse of language, “pingfulness” can also be
used as an exclamation, in which case it's a much stronger exclamation
than just “ping”!). Oppose `*blargh* <../B/blargh.html>`__.

The funniest use of ‘ping’ to date was
`described <http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1991Jan23.211609.877%40news.cs.indiana.edu>`__
in January 1991 by Steve Hayman on the Usenet group ``comp.sys.next``.
He was trying to isolate a faulty cable segment on a TCP/IP Ethernet
hooked up to a NeXT machine, and got tired of having to run back to his
console after each cabling tweak to see if the ping packets were getting
through. So he used the sound-recording feature on the NeXT, then wrote
a script that repeatedly invoked ping(8), listened for an echo, and
played back the recording on each returned packet. Result? A program
that caused the machine to repeat, over and over, “Ping ... ping ...
ping ...” as long as the network was up. He turned the volume to
maximum, ferreted through the building with one ear cocked, and found a
faulty tee connector in no time.

**Ping O' Death**: n.

A notorious `*exploit* <../E/exploit.html>`__ that (when first
discovered) could be easily used to crash a wide variety of machines by
overrunning size limits in their TCP/IP stacks. First revealed in late
1996. The open-source Unix community patched its systems to remove the
vulnerability within days or weeks, the closed-source OS vendors
generally took months. While the difference in response times repeated a
pattern familiar from other security incidents, the accompanying glare
of Web-fueled publicity proved unusually embarrassing to the OS vendors
and so passed into history and myth. The term is now used to refer to
any nudge delivered by network wizards over the network that causes bad
things to happen on the system being nudged. For the full story on the
original exploit, see
`http://www.insecure.org/sploits/ping-o-death.html <http://www.insecure.org/sploits/ping-o-death.html>`__.

In the late 1980s, researchers at Bell Labs (especially Rob Pike of

decided to reimplement the entire system. The result was called Plan 9
in “the Bell Labs tradition of selecting names that make marketeers
wince.” The developers also wished to pay homage to the famous film,
“Plan 9 From Outer Space”, considered by some to be the worst movie ever
made. The source is available for download under open-source terms. The
developers and a small fan base hang out at ``comp.os.plan9``, where one
can occasionally hear “If you want UNIX, you know where to find it”

[Unix] On systems that support `*finger* <../F/finger.html>`__, the
``.plan`` file in a user's home directory is displayed when the user is
fingered. This feature was originally intended to be used to keep
potential fingerers apprised of one's location and near-future plans,
but has been turned almost universally to humorous and self-expressive
purposes (like a `*sig block* <../S/sig-block.html>`__). See also
`*Hacking X for Y* <../H/Hacking-X-for-Y.html>`__.

A recent innovation in plan files has been the introduction of
“scrolling plan files” which are one-dimensional animations made using
only the printable ASCII character set, carriage return and line feed,
avoiding terminal specific escape sequences, since the
`*finger* <../F/finger.html>`__ command will (for security reasons; see
`*letterbomb* <../L/letterbomb.html>`__) not pass the escape character.

Scrolling .plan files have become art forms in miniature, and some sites
have started competitions to find who can create the longest running,
funniest, and most original animations. Various animation characters
include:

**platinum-iridium**: adj.

Standard, against which all others of the same category are measured.
Usage: silly. The notion is that one of whatever it is has actually been
cast in platinum-iridium alloy and placed in the vault beside the
Standard Kilogram at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
near Paris. (From 1889 to 1960, the meter was defined to be the distance
between two scratches in a platinum-iridium bar kept in that same vault
— this replaced an earlier definition as ``10-7`` times the distance
between the North Pole and the Equator along a meridian through Paris;
unfortunately, this had been based on an inexact value of the
circumference of the Earth. From 1960 to 1984 it was defined to be
1650763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red line of krypton-86 propagating
in a vacuum. It is now defined as the length of the path traveled by
light in a vacuum in the time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. The
kilogram is now the only unit of measure officially defined in terms of
a unique artifact. But this will have to change; in 2003 it was revealed
that the reference kilogram has been shedding mass over time, and is
down by 50 micrograms.) “This garbage-collection algorithm has been
tested against the platinum-iridium cons cell in Paris.” Compare

**plokta**: /plok´t@/, v.

[acronym: Press Lots Of Keys To Abort] To press random keys in an
attempt to get some response from the system. One might plokta when the
abort procedure for a program is not known, or when trying to figure out
if the system is just sluggish or really hung. Plokta can also be used
while trying to figure out any unknown key sequence for a particular
operation. Someone going into plokta mode usually places both hands flat
on the keyboard and mashes them down, hoping for some useful response.

A slightly more directed form of plokta can often be seen in mail
messages or Usenet articles from new users — the text might end with

**plumbing**: n.

[Unix] Term used for `*shell* <../S/shell.html>`__ code, so called
because of the prevalence of pipelines that feed the output of one
program to the input of another. Under Unix, user utilities can often be
implemented or at least prototyped by a suitable collection of pipelines
and temp-file grinding encapsulated in a shell script; this is much less
effort than writing C every time, and the capability is considered one
of Unix's major winning features. A few other OSs such as IBM's VM/CMS
support similar facilities. Esp.: used in the construction hairy
plumbing (see `*hairy* <../H/hairy.html>`__). “You can kluge together a
basic spell-checker out of sort(1), comm(1), and tr(1) with a little
plumbing.” See also `*tee* <../T/tee.html>`__.

Postel's Prescription

**Postel's Prescription**

[proposed] Several of the key Internet `*RFC* <../R/RFC.html>`__\ s,
especially 1122 and 791 contain a piece of advice due to Jon Postel,
which is most often stated as:

    “Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.”

That is, a well-engineered implementation of any of the Internet
protocols should be willing to deal with marginal and imperfectly-formed
inputs, but should not assume that the program on the other end (that
is, the program dealing with the well-engineered implementation's
output) will be anything other than rigid and inflexible, and perhaps
even incomplete or downright buggy.

This property is valuable because a network of programs adhering to it
will be much more robust in the presence of any uncertainties in the
protocol specifications, or any individual implementor's failure to
understand those specifications perfectly. Though the policy does tend
to accommodate broken implementations it is held to more important to
get the communication flowing than to immediately (but terminally)
diagnose the broken implementations at the expense of the people trying
to use them.

The principle is a well-known one in the design of programs that handle
Internet wire protocols, especially network relays and servers, and it
is regularly applied by extension in any situation where two or more
separately-implemented pieces of software are supposed to interoperate
even though the various implementors have never talked to each other and
have absolutely nothing whatsoever in common other than having all read
the same protocol specification. The principle travels under several
different names, including “the Internet credo”, “the IETF maxim”, “the
Internet Engineering Principle”, and “the liberal/conservative rule”;
the [proposed] term “Postel' Prescription” is a tribute to its inventor,
the first RFC editor and (until his untimely death) probably the single
most respected individual in the Internet engineering community.

ordinary `*email* <../E/email.html>`__ message by the fact that it is
broadcast rather than point-to-point. It is not clear whether messages
sent to a small mailing list are postings or email; perhaps the best
dividing line is that if you don't know the names of all the potential

PostScript

`Prev <postmaster.html>`__ 

P

 `Next <pound-on.html>`__

--------------

**PostScript**: n.

A page description language, based on work originally done by John
Gaffney at Evans and Sutherland in 1976, evolving through ‘JaM’ (‘John
and Martin’, Martin Newell) at `*XEROX PARC* <../X/XEROX-PARC.html>`__,
and finally implemented in its current form by John Warnock et al. after
he and Chuck Geschke founded Adobe Systems Incorporated in 1982.
PostScript gets its leverage by using a full programming language,
rather than a series of low-level escape sequences, to describe an image
to be printed on a laser printer or other output device (in this it
parallels `*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__, which exploited a similar
insight about editing tasks). It is also noteworthy for implementing
on-the fly rasterization, from Bezier curve descriptions, of
high-quality fonts at low (e.g. 300 dpi) resolution (it was formerly
believed that hand-tuned bitmap fonts were required for this task).
Hackers consider PostScript to be among the most elegant hacks of all
time, and the combination of technical merits and widespread
availability has made PostScript the language of choice for graphical
output.

**precedence lossage**: /pre´s@·dens los'@j/, n.

[C programmers] Coding error in an expression due to unexpected grouping
of arithmetic or logical operators by the compiler. Used esp. of certain
common coding errors in C due to the nonintuitively low precedence
levels of **&**, **\|**, **^**, **<<**, and **>>** (for this reason,
experienced C programmers deliberately forget the language's
`*baroque* <../B/baroque.html>`__ precedence hierarchy and parenthesize
defensively). Can always be avoided by suitable use of parentheses.
`*LISP* <../L/LISP.html>`__ fans enjoy pointing out that this can't
happen in *their* favorite language, which eschews precedence entirely,
requiring one to use explicit parentheses everywhere. See `*aliasing

[Usenet; orig. fr. the Island MUD via Oxford University] Abbreviation
for “predictable”, used to signify or preempt responses that are
extremely predictable but have to be filled in for the sake of form (the
phrase is bracketed by <pred>...</pred>). X-Pred headers in mail or news
serve the same end. Figuring out the connection between the X-Pred
tagline and the thread is part of the entertainment. For example, it is
said that any thread about taxation must contain a reference to Raquel
Welch, if only to stop other people from mentioning her. This is
allegedly due to a Monty Python sketch where a character declares that
he would tax Raquel Welch, and he has a feeling she would tax him.

Avoidance of prime time was traditionally given as a major reason for
`*night mode* <../N/night-mode.html>`__ hacking. The term fell into
disuse during the early PC era, but has been revived to refer to times
of day or evening at which the Internet tends to be heavily loaded,

refer to the latter). This very common term is likely a holdover from
the days when printing terminals were the norm, perpetuated by
programming language constructs like `*C* <../C/C.html>`__'s printf(3).

**proprietary**: adj.

1. In `*marketroid* <../M/marketroid.html>`__-speak, superior; implies a
product imbued with exclusive magic by the unmatched brilliance of the
company's own hardware or software designers.

2. In the language of hackers and users, inferior; implies a product not
conforming to open-systems standards, and thus one that puts the
customer at the mercy of a vendor able to gouge freely on service and
upgrade charges after the initial sale has locked the customer in. Often
used in the phrase “proprietary crap”.

3. Synonym for closed-source or non-free, e.g. software issued without
license rights permitting the public to independently review, develop
and redistribute it.

Proprietary software should be distinguished from commercial software.
It is possible for software to be commercial (that is, intended to make
a profit for the producers) without being proprietary. The reverse is
also possible, for example in binary-only freeware.

As used by hackers, this never refers to niceties about the proper form

should use the forks in a Russian-style place setting; hackers don't
care about such things. It is used instead to describe any set of rules
that allow different machines or pieces of software to coordinate with
each other without ambiguity. So, for example, it does include niceties
about the proper form for addressing packets on a network or the order
in which one should use the forks in the Dining Philosophers Problem. It
implies that there is some common message format and an accepted set of
primitives or commands that all parties involved understand, and that
transactions among them follow predictable logical sequences. See also

numbers), and any number that passes several is, in some sense, almost
certainly prime. The hacker backgammon usage stems from the idea that a
pseudoprime is almost as good as a prime: it will do the same job unless
you are unlucky.

**punched card**:

[techspeak] (alt.: punch card) The signature medium of computing's
`*Stone Age* <../S/Stone-Age.html>`__, now obsolescent. The punched card
actually predated computers considerably, originating in 1801 as a
control device for mechanical looms. The version patented by Hollerith
and used with mechanical tabulating machines in the 1890 U.S. Census was
a piece of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm. There is a widespread myth
that it was designed to fit in the currency trays used for that era's
larger dollar bills, but recent investigations have falsified this.

IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married the
punched card to computers, encoding binary information as patterns of
small rectangular holes; one character per column, 80 columns per card.
Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and hole shapes were tried at
various times.

The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the IBM
punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards distributed
with many varieties of computers even today. See

**punt**: v.

[from the punch line of an old joke referring to American football:
“Drop back 15 yards and punt!”]

1. To give up, typically without any intention of retrying. “Let's punt
the movie tonight.” “I was going to hack all night to get this feature
in, but I decided to punt” may mean that you've decided not to stay up
all night, and may also mean you're not ever even going to put in the
feature.

2. More specifically, to give up on figuring out what the `*Right
Thing* <../R/Right-Thing.html>`__ is and resort to an inefficient hack.

3. A design decision to defer solving a problem, typically because one
cannot define what is desirable sufficiently well to frame an
algorithmic solution. “No way to know what the right form to dump the
graph in is — we'll punt that for now.”

4. To hand a tricky implementation problem off to some other section of
the design. “It's too hard to get the compiler to do that; let's punt to
the runtime system.”

5. To knock someone off an Internet or chat connection; a punter thus,
is a person or program that does this.

that this harks back to the horrible old fixed-field languages of the
