**nadger**: /nad´jr/, v.

[UK, from rude slang noun nadgers for testicles; compare American &
British bollixed] Of software or hardware (not people), to twiddle some
object in a hidden manner, generally so that it conforms better to some
format. For instance, string printing routines on 8-bit processors often
take the string text from the instruction stream, thus a print call
looks like **jsr print:"Hello world"**. The print routine has to nadger
the saved instruction pointer so that the processor doesn't try to
execute the text as instructions when the subroutine returns. See
`*adger* <../A/adger.html>`__.

**naive**: adj.

1. Untutored in the perversities of some particular program or system;
one who still tries to do things in an intuitive way, rather than the
right way (in really good designs these coincide, but most designs
aren't ‘really good’ in the appropriate sense). This trait is completely
unrelated to general maturity or competence, or even competence at any
other specific program. It is a sad commentary on the primitive state of
computing that the natural opposite of this term is often claimed to be
experienced user but is really more like cynical user.

2. Said of an algorithm that doesn't take advantage of some superior but
advanced technique, e.g., the `*bubble sort* <../B/bubble-sort.html>`__.
It may imply naivete on the part of the programmer, although there are
situations where a naive algorithm is preferred, because it is more
important to keep the code comprehensible than to go for maximum
performance. “I know the linear search is naive, but in this case the
list typically only has half a dozen items.” Compare `*brute
force* <../B/brute-force.html>`__.

is often referred to by adding a letter to NANA. For example, NANAU
would refer to ``news.admin.net-abuse.usenet``.

When spam began to be a serious problem around 1995, and a loose network
of anti-spammers formed to combat it, spammers immediately accused them
of being the `*backbone cabal* <../B/backbone-cabal.html>`__, or the
Cabal reborn. Though this was not true, spam-fighters ironically
accepted the label and the tag line “There is No Cabal” reappeared
(later, and now commonly, abbreviated to “TINC”). Nowadays “the Cabal”
is generally understood to refer to the NANA regulars.

A hypothetical fabrication technology in which objects are designed and
built with the individual specification and placement of each separate
atom. The first unequivocal nanofabrication experiments took place in
1990, for example with the deposition of individual xenon atoms on a
nickel substrate to spell the logo of a certain very large computer
company. Nanotechnology has been a hot topic in the hacker subculture
ever since the term was coined by K. Eric Drexler in his book *Engines
of Creation* (Anchor/Doubleday, ISBN 0-385-19973-2), where he predicted
that nanotechnology could give rise to replicating assemblers,
permitting an exponential growth of productivity and personal wealth
(there's an authorized transcription at

**nasal demons**: n.

Recognized shorthand on the Usenet group ``comp.std.c`` for any
unexpected behavior of a C compiler on encountering an undefined
construct. During a discussion on that group in early 1992, a regular
remarked “When the compiler encounters [a given undefined construct] it
is legal for it to make demons fly out of your nose” (the implication is
that the compiler may choose any arbitrarily bizarre way to interpret
the code without violating the ANSI C standard). Someone else followed
up with a reference to “nasal demons”, which quickly became established.

--------------

**neats vs. scruffies**: n.

The label used to refer to one of the continuing `*holy
wars* <../H/holy-wars.html>`__ in AI research. This conflict tangles
together two separate issues. One is the relationship between human
reasoning and AI; ‘neats’ tend to try to build systems that ‘reason’ in
some way identifiably similar to the way humans report themselves as
doing, while ‘scruffies’ profess not to care whether an algorithm
resembles human reasoning in the least as long as it works. More
importantly, neats tend to believe that logic is king, while scruffies
favor looser, more ad-hoc methods driven by empirical knowledge. To a
neat, scruffy methods appear promiscuous, successful only by accident,
and not productive of insights about how intelligence actually works; to
a scruffy, neat methods appear to be hung up on formalism and irrelevant
to the hard-to-capture ‘common sense’ of living intelligences.

**nerd**: n.

1. [mainstream slang] Pejorative applied to anyone with an above-average
IQ and few gifts at small talk and ordinary social rituals.

2. [jargon] Term of praise applied (in conscious ironic reference to
sense 1) to someone who knows what's really important and interesting
and doesn't care to be distracted by trivial chatter and silly status
games. Compare `*geek* <../G/geek.html>`__.

The word itself appears to derive from the lines “And then, just to show
them, I'll sail to Ka-Troo / And Bring Back an It-Kutch, a Preep and a
Proo, / A Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker, too!” in the Dr. Seuss book
*If I Ran the Zoo* (1950). (The spellings ‘nurd’ and ‘gnurd’ also used
to be current at MIT, where ‘nurd’ is reported from as far back as 1957;
however, `*knurd* <../K/knurd.html>`__ appears to have a separate
etymology.) How it developed its mainstream meaning is unclear, but
sense 1 seems to have entered mass culture in the early 1970s (there are
reports that in the mid-1960s it meant roughly “annoying misfit” without
the connotation of intelligence.

Hackers developed sense 2 in self-defense perhaps ten years later, and
some actually wear “Nerd Pride” buttons, only half as a joke. At MIT one
can find not only buttons but (what else?) pocket protectors bearing the
slogan and the MIT seal.

[Cisco] A command in a complex piece of software which is more likely to
be used by an extremely experienced user to tweak a setting of one sort

**netburp**: n.

[IRC] When `*netlag* <netlag.html>`__ gets really bad, and delays
between servers exceed a certain threshold, the
`*IRC* <../I/IRC.html>`__ network effectively becomes partitioned for a
period of time, and large numbers of people seem to be signing off at
the same time and then signing back on again when things get better. An
instance of this is called a netburp (or, sometimes,
`*netsplit* <netsplit.html>`__).

network address

**network address**: n.

(also net address) As used by hackers, means an address on ‘the’ network
(see `*the network* <../T/the-network.html>`__; this used to include
`*bang path* <../B/bang-path.html>`__ addresses but now always implies
an Internet address). Net addresses are often used in email text as a
more concise substitute for personal names; indeed, hackers may come to
know each other quite well by network names without ever learning each
others' ‘legal’ monikers. Display of a network address (e.g. on business
cards) used to function as an important hacker identification signal,
like lodge pins among Masons or tie-dyed T-shirts among Grateful Dead
fans. In the day of pervasive Internet this is less true, but you can
still be fairly sure that anyone with a network address handwritten on
his or her convention badge is a hacker.

network meltdown

N

 `Next <New-Jersey.html>`__

--------------

**network meltdown**: n.

A state of complete network overload; the network equivalent of
`*thrash* <../T/thrash.html>`__\ ing. This may be induced by a
`*Chernobyl packet* <../C/Chernobyl-packet.html>`__. See also
`*broadcast storm* <../B/broadcast-storm.html>`__, `*kamikaze
packet* <../K/kamikaze-packet.html>`__.

Network meltdown is often a result of network designs that are optimized
for a steady state of moderate load and don't cope well with the very
jagged, bursty usage patterns of the real world. One amusing instance of
this is triggered by the popular and very bloody shoot-'em-up game
*Doom* on the PC. When used in multiplayer mode over a network, the game
uses broadcast packets to inform other machines when bullets are fired.
This causes problems with weapons like the chain gun which fire rapidly
— it can blast the network into a meltdown state just as easily as it
shreds opposing monsters.

sometimes exchanged by persons on opposite sides of a dispute over
whether a `*newsgroup* <newsgroup.html>`__ should be created net-wide,
or (even more frequently) whether an obsolete one should be removed.
These usually settle out within a week or two as it becomes clear
whether the group has a natural constituency (usually, it doesn't). At
times, especially in the completely anarchic ``alt`` hierarchy, the
names of newsgroups themselves become a form of comment or humor; e.g.,
the group ``alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork`` which originated as a
birthday joke for a Muppets fan, or any number of specialized abuse
groups named after particularly notorious
`*flamer* <../F/flamer.html>`__\ s, e.g., ``alt.weemba``.

topic groups or `*fora* <../F/fora.html>`__. Usenet groups can be
unmoderated (anyone can post) or moderated (submissions are
automatically directed to a moderator, who edits or filters and then
posts the results). Some newsgroups have parallel `*mailing
list* <../M/mailing-list.html>`__\ s for Internet people with no netnews
access, with postings to the group automatically propagated to the list
and vice versa. Some moderated groups (especially those which are
actually gatewayed Internet mailing lists) are distributed as digests,
with groups of postings periodically collected into a single large
posting with an index.

Among the best-known are ``comp.lang.c`` (the C-language forum),
``comp.arch`` (on computer architectures), ``comp.unix.wizards`` (for
Unix wizards), ``rec.arts.sf.written`` and siblings (for science-fiction
fans), and ``talk.politics.misc`` (miscellaneous political discussions

in that crock!” Also used in its original sense of a variable name:
“This crock has ``N`` bugs, as ``N`` goes to infinity.” (The true number
of bugs is always at least ``N + 1``; see `*Lubarsky's Law of Cybernetic
Entomology* <../L/Lubarskys-Law-of-Cybernetic-Entomology.html>`__.)

2. A variable whose value is inherited from the current context. For
example, when a meal is being ordered at a restaurant, ``N`` may be
understood to mean however many people there are at the table. From the
remark “We'd like to order ``N`` wonton soups and a family dinner for
``N - 1``\ ” you can deduce that one person at the table wants to eat
only soup, even though you don't know how many people there are (see
`*great-wall* <../G/great-wall.html>`__).

3. ``Nth``: adj. The ordinal counterpart of ``N``, senses 1 and 2.

4. “Now for the ``N``\ th and last time...” In the specific context
“\ ``N``\ th-year grad student”, ``N`` is generally assumed to be at
least 4, and is usually 5 or more (see `*tenured graduate
student* <../T/tenured-graduate-student.html>`__). See also `*random
numbers* <../R/random-numbers.html>`__,

**Nightmare File System**: n.

Pejorative hackerism for Sun's Network File System (NFS). In any
nontrivial network of Suns where there is a lot of NFS cross-mounting,
when one Sun goes down, the others often freeze up. Some machine tries
to access the down one, and (getting no response) repeats indefinitely.
This causes it to appear dead to some messages (what is actually
happening is that it is locked up in what should have been a brief
excursion to a higher `*spl* <../S/spl.html>`__ level). Then another
machine tries to reach either the down machine or the pseudo-down
machine, and itself becomes pseudo-down. The first machine to discover
the down one is now trying both to access the down one and to respond to
the pseudo-down one, so it is even harder to reach. This situation
snowballs very quickly, and soon the entire network of machines is
frozen — worst of all, the user can't even abort the file access that
started the problem! Many of NFS's problems are excused by partisans as
being an inevitable result of its statelessness, which is held to be a
great feature (critics, of course, call it a great
`*misfeature* <../M/misfeature.html>`__). (ITS partisans are apt to cite
this as proof of Unix's alleged bogosity; ITS had a working NFS-like
shared file system with none of these problems in the early 1970s.) See
also `*broadcast storm* <../B/broadcast-storm.html>`__.

popularized by Jon Bentley's September 1985 *Bumper-Sticker Computer
Science* column in *Communications of the ACM*. It was there called the
“Rule of Credibility”, a name which seems not to have stuck. Other

[UK: from the children's books]

1. Small and un-useful, but demonstrating a point. Noddy programs are
often written by people learning a new language or system. The
archetypal noddy program is `*hello world* <../H/hello-world.html>`__.
Noddy code may be used to demonstrate a feature or bug of a compiler.
May be used of real hardware or software to imply that it isn't worth
using. “This editor's a bit noddy.”

2. A program that is more or less instant to produce. In this use, the
term does not necessarily connote uselessness, but describes a
`*hack* <../H/hack.html>`__ sufficiently trivial that it can be written
and debugged while carrying on (and during the space of) a normal
conversation. “I'll just throw together a noddy

[scientific computation]

1. Behaving in an erratic and unpredictable fashion; unstable. When used
to describe the behavior of a machine or program, it suggests that said
machine or program is being forced to run far outside of design
specifications. This behavior may be induced by unreasonable inputs, or
may be triggered when a more mundane bug sends the computation far off
from its expected course.

2. When describing the behavior of a person, suggests a tantrum or a
`*flame* <../F/flame.html>`__. “When you talk to Bob, don't mention the
drug problem or he'll go nonlinear for hours.” In this context, go
nonlinear connotes ‘blow up out of proportion’ (proportion connotes
linearity).

--------------

**NP-**: /N·P/, pref.

Extremely. Used to modify adjectives describing a level or quality of
difficulty; the connotation is often ‘more so than it should be’. This
is generalized from the computer-science terms NP-hard and NP-complete;
NP-complete problems all seem to be very hard, but so far no one has
found a proof that they are. NP is the set of
Nondeterministic-Polynomial problems, those that can be completed by a
nondeterministic Turing machine in an amount of time that is a
polynomial function of the size of the input; a solution for one
NP-complete problem would solve all the others. “Coding a BitBlt
implementation to perform correctly in every case is NP-annoying.”

Note, however, that strictly speaking this usage is misleading; there
are plenty of easy problems in class NP. NP-complete problems are hard
not because they are in class NP, but because they are the hardest
problems in class NP.

NSA line eater

`Prev <NP-.html>`__ 

N

 `Next <NSP.html>`__

--------------

**NSA line eater**: n.

The National Security Agency trawling program sometimes assumed to be
reading the net for the U.S. Government's spooks. Most hackers used to
think it was mythical but believed in acting as though existed just in
case. Since the mid-1990s it has gradually become known that the NSA
actually does this, quite illegally, through its Echelon program.

The standard countermeasure is to put loaded phrases like ‘KGB’, ‘Uzi’,
‘nuclear materials’, ‘Palestine’, ‘cocaine’, and ‘assassination’ in
their `*sig block* <../S/sig-block.html>`__\ s in a (probably futile)
attempt to confuse and overload the creature. The
`*GNU* <../G/GNU.html>`__ version of `*EMACS* <../E/EMACS.html>`__
actually has a command that randomly inserts a bunch of insidious
anarcho-verbiage into your edited text.

As far back as the 1970s there was a mainstream variant of this myth
involving a ‘Trunk Line Monitor’, which supposedly used speech
recognition to extract words from telephone trunks. This is much harder
than noticing keywords in email, and most of the people who originally
propagated it had no idea of then-current technology or the storage,
signal-processing, or speech recognition needs of such a project. On the
basis of mass-storage costs alone it would have been cheaper to hire 50
high-school students and just let them listen in.

Twenty years and several orders of technological magnitude later,
however, there are clear indications that the NSA has actually deployed
such filtering (again, very much against U.S. law). In 2000, the FBI
wants to get into this act with its ‘Carnivore’ surveillance system.

as files, features, or code sections. Often used to express a final
verdict. “What do you want me to do with that 80-meg session file?”
“Nuke it.”

3. Used of processes as well as files; nuke is a frequent verbal alias
for **kill -9** on Unix.

4. On IBM PCs, a bug that results in `*fandango on
core* <../F/fandango-on-core.html>`__ can trash the operating system,
including the FAT (the in-core copy of the disk block chaining
information). This can utterly scramble attached disks, which are then
said to have been nuked. This term is also used of analogous lossages on
Macintoshes and other micros without memory protection.

**number-crunching**: n.

[common] Computations of a numerical nature, esp. those that make
extensive use of floating-point numbers. The only thing
`*Fortrash* <../F/Fortrash.html>`__ is good for. This term is in
widespread informal use outside hackerdom and even in mainstream slang,
but has additional hackish connotations: namely, that the computations
are mindless and involve massive use of `*brute
force* <../B/brute-force.html>`__. This is not always
`*evil* <../E/evil.html>`__, esp. if it involves ray tracing or fractals
or some other use that makes `*pretty

used as screen backgrounds. See also `*crunch* <../C/crunch.html>`__.

**numbers**: n.

[scientific computation] Output of a computation that may not be
significant results but at least indicate that the program is running.
May be used to placate management, grant sponsors, etc. Making numbers
means running a program because output — any output, not necessarily
meaningful output — is needed as a demonstration of progress. See

**NUXI problem**: /nuk´see pro´bl@m/, n.

Refers to the problem of transferring data between machines with
differing byte-order. The string “UNIX” might look like “NUXI” on a
machine with a different byte sex (e.g., when transferring data from a
`*little-endian* <../L/little-endian.html>`__ to a
`*big-endian* <../B/big-endian.html>`__, or vice-versa). See also
`*middle-endian* <../M/middle-endian.html>`__,

**nybble**: /nib´l/, nibble, n.

[from v. nibble by analogy with ‘bite’ → ‘byte’] Four bits; one
`*hex* <../H/hex.html>`__ digit; a half-byte. Though ‘byte’ is now
techspeak, this useful relative is still jargon. Compare
`*byte* <../B/byte.html>`__; see also `*bit* <../B/bit.html>`__. The
more mundane spelling “nibble” is also commonly used. Apparently the
‘nybble’ spelling is uncommon in Commonwealth Hackish, as British
orthography would suggest the pronunciation /ni:´bl/.

Following ‘bit’, ‘byte’ and ‘nybble’ there have been quite a few
analogical attempts to construct unambiguous terms for bit blocks of
other sizes. All of these are strictly jargon, not techspeak, and not
very common jargon at that (most hackers would recognize them in context
but not use them spontaneously). We collect them here for reference
together with the ambiguous techspeak terms ‘word’, ‘half-word’, ‘double
word’, and ‘quad’ or quad word; some (indicated) have substantial
information separate entries.

+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The fundamental motivation for most of these jargon terms (aside from
the normal hackerly enjoyment of punning wordplay) is the extreme
ambiguity of the term word and its derivatives.
