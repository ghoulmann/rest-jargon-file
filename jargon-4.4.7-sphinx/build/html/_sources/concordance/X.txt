XEROX PARC
============


**XEROX PARC**: /zee´roks park´/, n.

The famed Palo Alto Research Center. For more than a decade, from the
early 1970s into the mid-1980s, PARC yielded an astonishing volume of
groundbreaking hardware and software innovations. The modern mice,
windows, and icons style of software interface was invented there. So
was the laser printer and the local-area network; and PARC's series of D
machines anticipated the powerful personal computers of the 1980s by a
decade. Sadly, the prophets at PARC were without honor in their own
company, so much so that it became a standard joke to describe PARC as a
place that specialized in developing brilliant ideas for everyone else.

The stunning shortsightedness and obtusity of XEROX's top-level
`suits <../S/suit.html>`__  has been well anatomized in *Fumbling The
Future: How XEROX Invented, Then Ignored, the First Personal Computer*
by Douglas K. Smith and Robert C. Alexander (William Morrow & Co., 1988,
ISBN 0-688-09511-9).

X
=====




**X**: /X/, n.

1. Used in various speech and writing contexts (also in lowercase) in
roughly its algebraic sense of ‘unknown within a set defined by context’
(compare `N <../N/N.html>`__). Thus, the abbreviation 680x0 stands for
68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, or 68040, and 80x86 stands for 80186, 80286,
80386, 80486, 80586 or 80686 (note that a Unix hacker might write these
as 680[0-6]0 and 80[1-6]86 or 680?0 and 80?86 respectively; see
`glob <../G/glob.html>`__).

2. [after the name of an earlier window system called ‘W’] An
over-sized, over-featured, over-engineered and incredibly
over-complicated window system developed at MIT and widely used on Unix
systems.


XOFF
======


**XOFF**: /X·of/, n.

Syn. `control-S <../C/control-S.html>`__.

XON
======




**XON**: /X·on/, n.

Syn. `*control-Q* <../C/control-Q.html>`__.


xor
=====



**xor**: /X´or/, /kzor/, conj.

Exclusive or. ‘A xor B’ means ‘A or B, but not both’. “I want to get
cherry pie xor a banana split.” This derives from the technical use of
the term as a function on truth-values that is true if exactly one of
its two arguments is true.


xref
======





**xref**: /X´ref/, v.,n.

Hackish standard abbreviation for cross-reference.

XXX
====





**XXX**: /X·X·X/, n.

A marker that attention is needed. Commonly used in program comments to
indicate areas that are kluged up or need to be. Some hackers liken
‘XXX’ to the notional heavy-porn movie rating. Compare
`FIXME <../F/FIXME.html>`__.


xyzzy
========



**xyzzy**: /X·Y·Z·Z·Y/, /X·Y·ziz´ee/, /ziz´ee/, /ik·ziz´ee/, adj.

[from the ADVENT game] The `canonical <../C/canonical.html>`__ ‘magic
word’. This comes from `ADVENT <../A/ADVENT.html>`__, in which the
idea is to explore an underground cave with many rooms and to collect
the treasures you find there. If you type xyzzy at the appropriate time,
you can move instantly between two otherwise distant points. If,
therefore, you encounter some bit of `magic <../M/magic.html>`__, you
might remark on this quite succinctly by saying simply “Xyzzy!”
“Ordinarily you can't look at someone else's screen if he has protected
it, but if you type quadruple-bucky-clear the system will let you do it
anyway.” “Xyzzy!” It's traditional for xyzzy to be an `Easter
egg <../E/Easter-egg.html>`__ in games with text interfaces.

Xyzzy has actually been implemented as an undocumented no-op command on
several OSes; in Data General's AOS/VS, for example, it would typically
respond “Nothing happens”, just as `ADVENT <../A/ADVENT.html>`__ did
if the magic was invoked at the wrong spot or before a player had
performed the action that enabled the word. In more recent 32-bit
versions, by the way, AOS/VS responds “Twice as much happens”.

Early versions of the popular ‘minesweeper’ game under Microsoft Windows
had a cheat mode triggered by the command ‘xyzzy<enter><right-shift>’
that turns the top-left pixel of the screen different colors depending
on whether or not the cursor is over a bomb. This feature temporarily
disappeared in Windows 98, but reappeared in Windows 2000.

The following passage from *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz* by L. Frank
Baum, suggesting a possible pre-ADVENT origin, has recently come to
light: “Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!” said Dorothy, who was now standing on both
feet. This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great
chattering and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up
to them.
