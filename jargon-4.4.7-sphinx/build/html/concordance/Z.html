<p><strong>Zawinski&#8217;s Law</strong></p>
<p>“Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs
which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.” Coined by Jamie
Zawinski (who called it the “Law of Software Envelopment”) to express
his belief that all truly useful programs experience pressure to evolve
into toolkits and application platforms (the mailer thing, he says, is
just a side effect of that). It is commonly cited, though with widely
varying degrees of accuracy.</p>

words (esp. in the construction zero out).</p>
<p>2. To erase; to discard all data from. Said of disks and directories,
where ‘zeroing’ need not involve actually writing zeroes throughout the

<h2>Zero-One-Infinity Rule<a class="headerlink" href="#zero-one-infinity-rule" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Zero-One-Infinity Rule</strong>: prov.</p>
<p>“Allow none of <a class="reference external" href="../F/foo.html">foo</a>, one of
<a class="reference external" href="../F/foo.html">foo</a>, or any number of <a class="reference external" href="../F/foo.html">foo</a>.”
A rule of thumb for software design, which instructs one to not place
<a class="reference external" href="../R/random.html">random</a> limits on the number of instances of a
given entity (such as: windows in a window system, letters in an OS&#8217;s
filenames, etc.). Specifically, one should either disallow the entity
entirely, allow exactly one instance (an “exception”), or allow as many
as the user wants — address space and memory permitting.</p>
<p>The logic behind this rule is that there are often situations where it
makes clear sense to allow one of something instead of none. However, if
one decides to go further and allow N (for N &gt; 1), then why not N+1? And
if N+1, then why not N+2, and so on? Once above 1, there&#8217;s no excuse not
to allow any N; hence, <a class="reference external" href="../I/infinity.html">infinity</a>.</p>
<p>Many hackers recall in this connection Isaac Asimov&#8217;s SF novel <em>The Gods
Themselves</em> in which a character announces that the number 2 is
impossible — if you&#8217;re going to believe in more than one universe, you
might as well believe in an infinite number of them.</p>

<p><strong>zeroth</strong>: /zee´rohth/, adj.</p>
<p>First. Among software designers, comes from C&#8217;s and LISP&#8217;s 0-based
indexing of arrays. Hardware people also tend to start counting at 0
instead of 1; this is natural since, e.g., the 256 states of 8 bits
correspond to the binary numbers 0, 1, ..., 255 and the digital devices
known as counters count in this way.</p>
<p>Hackers and computer scientists often like to call the first chapter of
a publication ‘Chapter 0’, especially if it is of an introductory nature
(one of the classic instances was in the First Edition of
<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id4">`K&amp;R&lt;../K/K-ampersand-R.html&gt;`__</span></a>). In recent years this trait has
also been observed among many pure mathematicians (who have an
independent tradition of numbering from 0). Zero-based numbering tends
to reduce <a class="reference external" href="../F/fencepost-error.html">fencepost error</a>s, though
it cannot eliminate them entirely.</p>

<p>A track called <em>Zorch</em> was the B-side of a single called <em>Captain
Hideous</em>, released by novelty artist Nervous Norvous in 1955. Norvous
was heavily influemced by a radio comedian named Red Blanchard; the word
“zorch” appears to have been coined on Blanchard&#8217;s show in the early
1950s. The word itself had no meaning, but there where compounds using
it that did — “zorch cow”, for example, was a variant of the
Chicago-area slang “black cow” for a root beer float.</p>
