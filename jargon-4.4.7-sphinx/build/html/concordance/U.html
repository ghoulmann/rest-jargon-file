<p><strong>Unix brain damage</strong>: n.</p>
<p>Something that has to be done to break a network program (typically a
mailer) on a non-Unix system so that it will interoperate with Unix
systems. The hack may qualify as Unix brain damage if the program
conforms to published standards and the Unix program in question does
not. Unix brain damage happens because it is much easier for other

than it is to change all the hundreds of thousands of Unix systems out
there.</p>
<p>An example of Unix brain damage is a <a class="reference external" href="../K/kluge.html">kluge</a> in a

<h2>Unix conspiracy<a class="headerlink" href="#unix-conspiracy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Unix conspiracy</strong>: n.</p>
<p>[ITS] According to a conspiracy theory long popular among
<a class="reference external" href="../I/ITS.html">ITS</a> and <a class="reference external" href="../T/TOPS-20.html">TOPS-20</a> fans,
Unix&#8217;s growth is the result of a plot, hatched during the 1970s at Bell
Labs, whose intent was to hobble AT&amp;T&#8217;s competitors by making them
dependent upon a system whose future evolution was to be under AT&amp;T&#8217;s
control. This would be accomplished by disseminating an operating system
that is apparently inexpensive and easily portable, but also relatively
unreliable and insecure (so as to require continuing upgrades from
AT&amp;T). This theory was lent a substantial impetus in 1984 by the paper
referenced in the <a class="reference external" href="../B/back-door.html">back door</a> entry.</p>
<p>In this view, Unix was designed to be one of the first computer viruses
(see <a class="reference external" href="../V/virus.html">virus</a>) — but a virus spread to computers
indirectly by people and market forces, rather than directly through
disks and networks. Adherents of this ‘Unix virus’ theory like to cite
the fact that the well-known quotation “Unix is snake oil” was uttered
by <a class="reference external" href="../D/DEC.html">DEC</a> president Kenneth Olsen shortly before DEC
began actively promoting its own family of Unix workstations. (Olsen now
claims to have been misquoted.)</p>
<p>If there was ever such a conspiracy, it got thoroughly out of the
plotters&#8217; control after 1990. AT&amp;T sold its Unix operation to Novell
around the same time <a class="reference external" href="../L/Linux.html">Linux</a> and other free-Unix
distributions were beginning to make noise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unix">
<h2>Unix<a class="headerlink" href="#unix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Unix</strong>: /yoo´niks/, n.</p>
<p>[In the authors&#8217; words, “A weak pun on Multics”; very early on it was
“UNICS”] (also “UNIX”) An interactive timesharing system invented in
1969 by Ken Thompson after Bell Labs left the Multics project,
originally so he could play games on his scavenged PDP-7. Dennis
Ritchie, the inventor of C, is considered a co-author of the system. The
turning point in Unix&#8217;s history came when it was reimplemented almost
entirely in C during 1972—1974, making it the first source-portable OS.
Unix subsequently underwent mutations and expansions at the hands of
many different people, resulting in a uniquely flexible and
developer-friendly environment. By 1991, Unix had become the most widely
used multiuser general-purpose operating system in the world — and since
1996 the variant called <a class="reference external" href="../L/Linux.html">Linux</a> has been at the
cutting edge of the <a class="reference external" href="../O/open-source.html">open source</a> movement.
Many people consider the success of Unix the most important victory yet
of hackerdom over industry opposition (but see <a class="reference external" href="Unix-weenie.html">Unix
weenie</a> and <a class="reference external" href="Unix-conspiracy.html">Unix
conspiracy</a> for an opposing point of view).
See <a class="reference external" href="../V/Version-7.html">Version 7</a>, <a class="reference external" href="../B/BSD.html">BSD</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="../L/Linux.html">Linux</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="image0" src="concordance/../graphics/richiethompson.jpg" /></p>
<p>Archetypal hackers ken (left) and dmr (right).</p>
<p>Some people are confused over whether this word is appropriately ‘UNIX’
or ‘Unix’; both forms are common, and used interchangeably. Dennis
Ritchie says that the ‘UNIX’ spelling originally happened in CACM&#8217;s 1974
paper <em>The UNIX Time-Sharing System</em> because “we had a new typesetter
and <a class="reference external" href="../T/troff.html">troff</a> had just been invented and we were
intoxicated by being able to produce small caps.” Later, dmr tried to
get the spelling changed to ‘Unix’ in a couple of Bell Labs papers, on
the grounds that the word is not acronymic. He failed, and eventually
(his words) “wimped out” on the issue. So, while the trademark today is
‘UNIX’, both capitalizations are grounded in ancient usage; the Jargon
File uses ‘Unix’ in deference to dmr&#8217;s wishes.</p>

be a user with respect to some program he himself does not hack. A LISP
hacker might be one who maintains LISP or one who uses LISP (but with
the skill of a hacker). A LISP user is one who uses LISP, whether
skillfully or not. Thus there is some overlap between the two terms; the
subtle distinctions must be resolved by context.</p>

<p><strong>userland</strong>: n.</p>
<p>Anywhere outside the kernel. “That code belongs in userland.” This term
has been in common use among Unix kernel hackers since at least 1985,
and may have have originated in that community. The earliest sighting
was reported from the usenet group net.unix-wizards.</p>

<p><strong>Utah teapot, the</strong></p>
<p>This object is historically one of the first complex 3D models to be
rendered in computer graphics. It consisted of about 110 vertices, and
was generated by Martin Newell in 1974 using hand-drawn Bezier curves,
based on a real teapot that he and his wife had bought. This model
served as a basis for comparing various 3D rendering methodologies for
lighting, textures, bump-mapping, etc. By the standards of 2002, the
model is trivial to render and thus is often not suited to demonstrate
the complexity of modern research. Despite this, the tea pot still
appears, now and then, in recent papers. More on the teapot&#8217;s history
lives at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sjbaker.org/teapot/">The History Of The Teapot</a>.

<h2>UTSL<a class="headerlink" href="#utsl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>UTSL</strong>: //, n.</p>
<p>[Unix] On-line acronym for ‘Use the Source, Luke’ (a pun on Obi-Wan
Kenobi&#8217;s “Use the Force, Luke!” in <em>Star Wars</em>) — analogous to
<a class="reference external" href="../R/RTFS.html">RTFS</a> (sense 1), but more polite. This is a common
way of suggesting that someone would be better off reading the source
code that supports whatever feature is causing confusion, rather than
making yet another futile pass through the manuals, or broadcasting
questions on Usenet that haven&#8217;t attracted
<a class="reference external" href="../W/wizard.html">wizard</a>s to answer them.</p>
<p>Once upon a time in <a class="reference external" href="../E/elder-days.html">elder days</a>, everyone
running Unix had source. After 1978, AT&amp;T&#8217;s policy tightened up, so this
objurgation was in theory appropriately directed only at associates of
some outfit with a Unix source license. In practice, bootlegs of Unix
source code (made precisely for reference purposes) were so ubiquitous
that one could utter it at almost anyone on the network without concern.</p>
<p>Nowadays, free Unix clones have become widely enough distributed that
anyone can read source legally. The most widely distributed is certainly
Linux, with variants of the NET/2 and 4.4BSD distributions running
second. Cheap commercial Unixes with source such as BSD/OS are
accelerating this trend.</p>

<p><strong>UUOC</strong></p>
<p>[from the comp.unix.shell group on Usenet] Stands for Useless Use of
<a class="reference external" href="../C/cat.html">cat</a>; the reference is to the Unix command cat(1),
not the feline animal. As received wisdom on comp.unix.shell observes,
“The purpose of cat is to concatenate (or ‘catenate’) files. If it&#8217;s
only one file, concatenating it with nothing at all is a waste of time,
and costs you a process.” Nevertheless one sees people doing</p>
