<div class="section" id="talk-mode">
<h2>talk mode<a class="headerlink" href="#talk-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>talk mode</strong>: n.</p>
<p>A feature supported by Unix and some other OSes that allows two or more
logged-in users to set up a real-time on-line conversation. It combines
the immediacy of talking with all the precision (and verbosity) that
written language entails. It is difficult to communicate inflection,
though conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section on
writing style in the Prependices for details).</p>
<p>Talk mode has a special set of jargon words, used to save typing, which
are not used orally. Some of these are identical to (and probably
derived from) Morse-code jargon used by ham-radio amateurs since the
1920s.</p>
<p>Most of these are not used at universities or in the Unix world, though
ROTF and TTFN have gained some currency there and IMHO is common;
conversely, most of the people who know these are unfamiliar with FOO?,
BCNU, HELLOP, <a class="reference external" href="../N/NIL.html">NIL</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="T.html">T</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="../M/MUD.html">MUD</a> community uses a mixture of
Usenet/Internet emoticons, a few of the more natural of the old-style
talk-mode abbrevs, and some of the ‘social’ list above; specifically,
MUD respondents report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW, WTF, TTFN, and
WTH. The use of rehi is also common; in fact, mudders are fond of re-
compounds and will frequently rehug or rebonk (see
<a class="reference external" href="../B/bonk-oif.html">bonk/oif</a>) people. The word re by itself is
taken as ‘regreet’. In general, though, MUDders express a preference for
typing things out in full rather than using abbreviations; this may be
due to the relative youth of the MUD cultures, which tend to include
many touch typists and to assume high-speed links. The following uses
specific to MUDs are reported:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="11%" />
<col width="89%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>CU l8er</td>
<td>see you later (mutant of <strong>CU l8tr</strong>)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>FOAD</td>
<td>fuck off and die (use of this is generally OTT)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>OTT</td>
<td>over the top (excessive, uncalled for)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>ppl</td>
<td>abbrev for “people”</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>THX</td>
<td>thanks (mutant of <strong>TNX</strong>; clearly this comes in batches of 1138 (the Lucasian K)).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>UOK?</td>
<td>are you OK?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Some <a class="reference external" href="../B/B1FF.html">B1FF</a>isms (notably the variant spelling
<strong>d00d</strong>) appear to be passing into wider use among some subgroups of
MUDders.</p>
<p>One final note on talk mode style: neophytes, when in talk mode, often
seem to think they must produce letter-perfect prose because they are
typing rather than speaking. This is not the best approach. It can be
very frustrating to wait while your partner pauses to think of a word,
or repeatedly makes the same spelling error and backs up to fix it. It
is usually best just to leave typographical errors behind and plunge
forward, unless severe confusion may result; in that case it is often
fastest just to type “xxx” and start over from before the mistake.</p>

<p>[acronym, from Robert Heinlein&#8217;s classic SF novel <em>The Moon is a Harsh

<p>Outside hacker circles the variant TINSTAAFL (“There is No Such

from it by mutation.</p>

<p>1. [Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol] The
wide-area-networking protocol that makes the Internet work, and the only
one most hackers can speak the name of without laughing or retching.
Unlike such allegedly ‘standard’ competitors such as X.25, DECnet, and
the ISO 7-layer stack, TCP/IP evolved primarily by actually being
<em>used</em>, rather than being handed down from on high by a vendor or a
heavily-politicized standards committee. Consequently, it (a) works, (b)
actually promotes cheap cross-platform connectivity, and (c) annoys the
hell out of corporate and governmental empire-builders everywhere.
Hackers value all three of these properties. See

<div class="section" id="teco">
<h2>TECO<a class="headerlink" href="#teco" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>TECO</strong>: /tee´koh/, n.,v. obs.</p>
<p>1. [originally an acronym for ‘[paper] Tape Editor and COrrector’;
later, ‘Text Editor and COrrector’] n. A text editor developed at MIT
and modified by just about everybody. With all the dialects included,
TECO may have been the most prolific editor in use before
<a class="reference external" href="../E/EMACS.html">EMACS</a>, to which it was directly ancestral. Noted
for its powerful programming-language-like features and its unspeakably
<a class="reference external" href="../H/hairy.html">hairy</a> syntax. It is literally the case that
every string of characters is a valid TECO program (though probably not
a useful one); one common game used to be mentally working out what the
TECO commands corresponding to human names did.</p>
<p>2. vt. Originally, to edit using the TECO editor in one of its infinite
variations (see below).</p>
<p>3. vt.,obs. To edit even when TECO is <em>not</em> the editor being used! This
usage is rare and now primarily historical.</p>
<p>As an example of TECO&#8217;s obscurity, here is a TECO program that takes a
list of names such as:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Loser, J. Random</div>
<div class="line">Quux, The Great</div>
<div class="line">Dick, Moby</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>sorts them alphabetically according to surname, and then puts the
surname last, removing the comma, to produce the following:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Moby Dick</div>
<div class="line">J. Random Loser</div>
<div class="line">The Great Quux</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The program is</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">[1 J^P$L$$</div>
<div class="line">J &lt;.-Z; .,(S,$ -D .)FX1 &#64;F^B $K :L I $ G1 L&gt;$$</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>(where ^B means ‘Control-B’ (ASCII 0000010) and $ is actually an
<a class="reference external" href="../A/alt.html">alt</a> or escape (ASCII 0011011) character).</p>
<p>In fact, this very program was used to produce the second, sorted list
from the first list. The first hack at it had a
<a class="reference external" href="../B/bug.html">bug</a>: GLS (the author) had accidentally omitted the
<strong>&#64;</strong> in front of <strong>F^B</strong>, which as anyone can see is clearly the
<a class="reference external" href="../W/Wrong-Thing.html">Wrong Thing</a>. It worked fine the second
time. There is no space to describe all the features of TECO, but it may
be of interest that <strong>^P</strong> means ‘sort’ and <strong>J&lt;.-Z; ... L&gt;</strong> is an
idiomatic series of commands for ‘do once for every line’.</p>
<p>In mid-1991, TECO is pretty much one with the dust of history, having
been replaced in the affections of hackerdom by
<a class="reference external" href="../E/EMACS.html">EMACS</a>. Descendants of an early (and somewhat
lobotomized) version adopted by DEC can still be found lurking on VMS

<p><strong>TeX</strong>: /tekh/, n.</p>
<p>An extremely powerful <a class="reference external" href="../M/macro.html">macro</a>-based text formatter
written by Donald E. <a class="reference external" href="../K/Knuth.html">Knuth</a>, very popular in the
computer-science community (it is good enough to have displaced Unix
<a class="reference external" href="troff.html">troff</a>, the other favored formatter, even at many Unix
installations). TeX fans insist on the correct (guttural) pronunciation,
and the correct spelling (all caps, squished together, with the E
depressed below the baseline; the mixed-case ‘TeX’ is considered an
acceptable kluge on ASCII-only devices). Fans like to proliferate names
from the word ‘TeX’ — such as TeXnician (TeX user), TeXhacker (TeX
programmer), TeXmaster (competent TeX programmer), TeXhax, and TeXnique.
See also <a class="reference external" href="../C/CrApTeX.html">CrApTeX</a>.</p>
<p>Knuth began TeX because he had become annoyed at the declining quality
of the typesetting in volumes I&#8211;III of his monumental <em>Art of Computer
Programming</em> (see <a class="reference external" href="../K/Knuth.html">Knuth</a>, also
<a class="reference external" href="../B/bible.html">bible</a>). In a manifestation of the typical
hackish urge to solve the problem at hand once and for all, he began to
design his own typesetting language. He thought he would finish it on
his sabbatical in 1978; he was wrong by only about 8 years. The language
was finally frozen around 1985, but volume IV of <em>The Art of Computer
Programming</em> is not expected to appear until 2007. The impact and
influence of TeX&#8217;s design has been such that nobody minds this very
much. Many grand hackish projects have started as a bit of
<a class="reference external" href="toolsmith.html">toolsmith</a>ing on the way to something else;
Knuth&#8217;s diversion was simply on a grander scale than most.</p>
<p>TeX has also been a noteworthy example of free, shared, but high-quality
software. Knuth offers a monetary award to anyone who found and reported
bugs dating from before the 1989 code freeze; as the years wore on and
the few remaining bugs were fixed (and new ones even harder to find),
the bribe went up. Though well-written, TeX is so large (and so full of
cutting edge technique) that it is said to have unearthed at least one
bug in every Pascal system it has been compiled with.</p>

<p>Scheduler thrashing. This can happen under Unix when you have a number

possibly handle the event is awakened. In the end, only one of those
processes will actually be able to do the work, but, in the meantime,
all the others wake up and contend for CPU time before being put back to

<h2>thunk<a class="headerlink" href="#thunk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>thunk</strong>: /thuhnk/, n.</p>
<p>1. [obs.]“A piece of coding which provides an address:”, according to P.
Z. Ingerman, who invented thunks in 1961 as a way of binding actual
parameters to their formal definitions in Algol-60 procedure calls. If a
procedure is called with an expression in the place of a formal
parameter, the compiler generates a thunk which computes the expression
and leaves the address of the result in some standard location.</p>
<p>2. Later generalized into: an expression, frozen together with its
environment, for later evaluation if and when needed (similar to what in
techspeak is called a closure). The process of unfreezing these thunks
is called forcing.</p>
<p>3. A <a class="reference external" href="../S/stubroutine.html">stubroutine</a>, in an overlay
programming environment, that loads and jumps to the correct overlay.

“16-bit environment” (with bletcherous segment registers and 64K address
limits) and a “32-bit environment” (with flat addressing and semi-real
memory management). The two environments can both be running on the same
computer and OS (thanks to what is called, in the Microsoft world, WOW
which stands for Windows On Windows). MS and IBM have both decided that
the process of getting from 16- to 32-bit and vice versa is called a
“thunk”; for Windows 95, there is even a tool THUNK.EXE called a “thunk
compiler”.</p>
<p>5. A person or activity scheduled in a thunklike manner. “It occurred to
me the other day that I am rather accurately modeled by a thunk — I
frequently need to be forced to completion.:” — paraphrased from a
<a class="reference external" href="../P/plan-file.html">plan file</a>.</p>
<p>Historical note: There are a couple of onomatopoeic myths circulating
about the origin of this term. The most common is that it is the sound
made by data hitting the stack; another holds that the sound is that of
the data hitting an accumulator. Yet another suggests that it is the
sound of the expression being unfrozen at argument-evaluation time. In
fact, according to the inventors, it was coined after they realized (in
the wee hours after hours of discussion) that the type of an argument in
Algol-60 could be figured out in advance with a little compile-time
thought, simplifying the evaluation machinery. In other words, it had
‘already been thought of’; thus it was christened a thunk, which is “the
past tense of ‘think’ at two in the morning”.</p>

the <a class="reference external" href="../D/DEC.html">DEC</a> 10, 11, and <a class="reference external" href="../V/VAX.html">VAX</a>
lines. But these were only cheap in a relative sense; though quite a bit
less powerful than today&#8217;s personal computers, they had to be shared by
dozens or even hundreds of people each. The early hacker comunities
nucleated around places where it was relatively easy to get access to a
timesharing account.</p>
<p>Nowadays, communications bandwidth is usually the most important
constraint on what you can do with your computer. Not so back then;
timesharing machines were often loaded to capacity, and it was not
uncommon for everyone&#8217;s work to grind to a halt while the machine
scheduler thrashed, trying to figure out what to do next. Early hacker
slang was replete with terms like cycle crunch and cycle drought for
describing the consequences of too few instructions-per-second spread
among too many users. As GLS has noted, this sort of problem influenced
the tendency of many hackers to work odd schedules.</p>
<p>One reason this is worth noting here is to make the point that the
earliest hacker communities were physical, not distributed via networks;
they consisted of hackers who shared a machine and therefore had to deal
with many of the same problems with respect to it. A system crash could
idle dozens of eager programmers, all sitting in the same terminal room
and with little to do but talk with each other until normal operation
resumed.</p>
<p>Timesharing moved from being the luxury of a few large universities
runing semi-experimental operating systems to being more generally
available about 1975-76. Hackers in search of more cycles and more
control over their programming environment began to migrate off
timesharing machines and onto what are now called workstations around
1983. It took another ten years, the development of powerful 32-bit
personal micros, the <a class="reference external" href="../G/Great-Internet-Explosion.html">Great Internet
Explosion</a> before the migration
was complete. It is no coincidence that the last stages of this
migration coincided with the development of the first open-source
operating systems.</p>

<h2>TMRC<a class="headerlink" href="#tmrc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>TMRC</strong>: /tmerk´/, n.</p>
<p>The Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT, one of the wellsprings of hacker
culture. The 1959 <em>Dictionary of the TMRC Language</em> compiled by Peter
Samson included several terms that became basics of the hackish
vocabulary (see esp. <a class="reference external" href="../F/foo.html">foo</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="../M/mung.html">mung</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="../F/frob.html">frob</a>).</p>
<p>By 1962, TMRC&#8217;s legendary layout was already a marvel of complexity and
has grown in the years since. All the features described here were still
present when the old layout was decommissioned in 1998 just before the
demolition of MIT Building 20, and will almost certainly be retained
when the old layout is rebuilt (expected in 2003). The control system
alone featured about 1200 relays. There were <a class="reference external" href="../S/scram-switch.html">scram
switch</a>es located at numerous places
around the room that could be thwacked if something undesirable was
about to occur, such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction.
Another feature of the system was a digital clock on the dispatch board,
which was itself something of a wonder in those bygone days before cheap
LEDs and seven-segment displays. When someone hit a scram switch the
clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word ‘FOO’; at TMRC
the scram switches are therefore called foo switches.</p>
<p>Steven Levy, in his book <em>Hackers</em> (see the
<a class="reference external" href="../pt03.html#bibliography">Bibliography</a> in Appendix C), gives a
stimulating account of those early years. TMRC&#8217;s Signals and Power
Committee included many of the early PDP-1 hackers and the people who
later became the core of the MIT AI Lab staff. Thirty years later that
connection is still very much alive, and this lexicon accordingly
includes a number of entries from a recent revision of the TMRC
dictionary.</p>

items as a particular version of a compiler, libraries, special headers,

tools which render from some markup to a variety of production formats.
Differs from ‘toolkit’ in that the former implies a collection of
semi-independent tools with complementary functions, while ‘toolchain’
implies that each of the parts is a serial stage in a rather tightly
bound pipeline. Seems to have become current in early 1999 and 2000; now

isn&#8217;t due to forgetfulness or laziness. A single post may often result
in several posts each responding to a different point in the original.
Some subthreads will actually be in response to some off-the-cuff side

<h2>troff<a class="headerlink" href="#troff" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>troff</strong>: /T´rof/, /trof/, n.</p>
<p>[Unix] The gray eminence of Unix text processing; a formatting and
phototypesetting program, written originally in
<a class="reference external" href="../P/PDP-11.html">PDP-11</a> assembler and then in barely-structured
early C by the late Joseph Ossanna, modeled after the earlier ROFF which
was in turn modeled after the <a class="reference external" href="../M/Multics.html">Multics</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="../C/CTSS.html">CTSS</a> program RUNOFF by Jerome Saltzer (<em>that</em>
name came from the expression “to run off a copy”). A companion program,
nroff, formats output for terminals and line printers.</p>
<p>In 1979, Brian Kernighan modified troff so that it could drive
phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT. His paper
describing that work (“A Typesetter-independent troff,” AT&amp;T CSTR #97)
explains troff&#8217;s durability. After discussing the program&#8217;s “obvious
deficiencies — a rebarbative input syntax, mysterious and undocumented
properties in some areas, and a voracious appetite for computer
resources” and noting the ugliness and extreme hairiness of the code and
internals, Kernighan concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>None of these remarks should be taken as denigrating Ossanna&#8217;s
accomplishment with TROFF. It has proven a remarkably robust tool,
taking unbelievable abuse from a variety of preprocessors and being
forced into uses that were never conceived of in the original
design, all with considerable grace under fire.</div></blockquote>
<p>The success of <a class="reference external" href="TeX.html">TeX</a> and desktop publishing systems have
reduced <strong>troff</strong>&#8216;s relative importance, but this tribute perfectly
captures the strengths that secured <strong>troff</strong> a place in hacker

those qualities of good programs that, in the long run, hackers most
admire.</p>

want to utter flame bait. Like the ugly creatures they are named after,
they exhibit no redeeming characteristics, and as such, they are

of computations they can carry out, and in principle have capabilities
that differ only in speed from those of the most powerful and elegantly
designed computers. However, no machine or language exactly matching
Turing&#8217;s primitive set has ever been built (other than possibly as a
classroom exercise), because it would be horribly slow and far too
painful to use. A Turing tar-pit is any computer language or other tool
that shares this property. That is, it&#8217;s theoretically universal — but
in practice, the harder you struggle to get any real work done, the
deeper its inadequacies suck you in. Compare <a class="reference external" href="../B/bondage-and-discipline-language.html">bondage-and-discipline

<p>Tux the Penguin is the official emblem of <a class="reference external" href="../L/Linux.html">Linux</a>,
This eventuated after a logo contest in 1996, during which Linus
Torvalds endorsed the idea of a penguin logo in a couple of famously
funny <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sjbaker.org/tux/">postings</a>. Linus explained that
he was once bitten by a killer penguin in Australia and has felt a
special affinity for the species ever since. (Linus has since admitted
that he was also thinking of Feathers McGraw, the evil-genius penguin
jewel thief who appeared in a Wallace &amp; Grommit feature cartoon, <em>The
Wrong Trousers</em>.)</p>
<p>Larry Ewing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/">designed</a> the
official Tux logo. It has proved a wise choice, amenable to hundreds of
recognizable variations used as emblems of Linux-related projects,
products, and user groups. In fact, Tux has spawned an entire mythology,
of which the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ao.com/~regan/penguins/tux.html">Gospel According to
Tux</a> and the mock-epic
poem <em>Tuxowolf</em> are among the best-known examples.</p>
<p>There is a ‘real’ Tux — a black-footed penguin resident at the Bristol
Zoo. Several friends of Linux bought a zoo sponsorship for Linus as a
birthday present in 1996.</p>

<h2>TWENEX<a class="headerlink" href="#twenex" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>TWENEX</strong>: /twe´neks/, n.</p>
<p>The TOPS-20 operating system by <a class="reference external" href="../D/DEC.html">DEC</a> — the second
proprietary OS for the PDP-10 — preferred by most PDP-10 hackers over
TOPS-10 (that is, by those who were not <a class="reference external" href="../I/ITS.html">ITS</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="../W/WAITS.html">WAITS</a> partisans). TOPS-20 began in 1969 as Bolt,
Beranek &amp; Newman&#8217;s TENEX operating system using special paging hardware.
By the early 1970s, almost all of the systems on the ARPANET ran TENEX.
DEC purchased the rights to TENEX from BBN and began work to make it
their own. The first in-house code name for the operating system was
VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System); when customers started asking
questions, the name was changed to SNARK so DEC could truthfully deny
that there was any project called VIROS. When the name SNARK became
known, the name was briefly reversed to become KRANS; this was quickly
abandoned when someone objected that krans meant ‘funeral wreath’ in
Swedish (though some Swedish speakers have since said it means simply
‘wreath’; this part of the story may be apocryphal). Ultimately DEC
picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system, and it was as
TOPS-20 that it was marketed. The hacker community, mindful of its
origins, quickly dubbed it TWENEX (a contraction of ‘twenty TENEX’),
even though by this point very little of the original TENEX code
remained (analogously to the differences between AT&amp;T V6 Unix and BSD).
DEC people cringed when they heard “TWENEX”, but the term caught on
nevertheless (the written abbreviation ‘20x’ was also used). TWENEX was
successful and very popular; in fact, there was a period in the early
1980s when it commanded as fervent a culture of partisans as Unix or ITS
— but DEC&#8217;s decision to scrap all the internal rivals to the
<a class="reference external" href="../V/VAX.html">VAX</a> architecture and its relatively stodgy VMS OS
killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to TWENEX&#8217;s brief day in the sun.
DEC attempted to convince TOPS-20 users to convert to
<a class="reference external" href="../V/VMS.html">VMS</a>, but instead, by the late 1980s, most of the
TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to Unix. There is a <a class="reference external" href="http://panda.com/tops-20/">TOPS-20 home

<h2>twirling baton<a class="headerlink" href="#twirling-baton" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>twirling baton</strong>: n.</p>
<p>[PLATO] The overstrike sequence -/|\-/|\- which produces an animated
twirling baton. If you output it with a single backspace between
characters, the baton spins in place. If you output the sequence BS SP
between characters, the baton spins from left to right. If you output BS
SP BS BS between characters, the baton spins from right to left. This is
also occasionally called a twiddle prompt.</p>
<p>The twirling baton was a popular component of animated signature files
on the pioneering PLATO educational timesharing system. The <strong>archie</strong>
Internet service is perhaps the best-known baton program today; it uses
the twirling baton as an idler indicating that the program is working on
a query. The twirling baton is also used as a boot progress indicator on
several BSD variants of Unix; if it stops, you&#8217;re probably going to have
