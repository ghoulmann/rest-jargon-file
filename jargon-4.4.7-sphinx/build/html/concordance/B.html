<p><strong>backbone cabal</strong>: n.</p>
<p>A group of large-site administrators who pushed through the <a class="reference external" href="../G/Great-Renaming.html">Great
Renaming</a> and reined in the chaos of
<a class="reference external" href="../U/Usenet.html">Usenet</a> during most of the 1980s. During most of
its lifetime, the Cabal (as it was sometimes capitalized) steadfastly
denied its own existence; it was almost obligatory for anyone privy to
their secrets to respond “There is no Cabal” whenever the existence or
activities of the group were speculated on in public.</p>
<p>The result of this policy was an attractive aura of mystery. Even a
decade after the cabal <a class="reference external" href="../M/mailing-list.html">mailing list</a>
disbanded in late 1988 following a bitter internal catfight, many people
believed (or claimed to believe) that it had not actually disbanded but
only gone deeper underground with its power intact.</p>
<p>This belief became a model for various paranoid theories about various
Cabals with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking over the
Usenet or Internet. These paranoias were later satirized in ways that
took on a life of their own. See <a class="reference external" href="../E/Eric-Conspiracy.html">Eric
Conspiracy</a> for one example. Part of the
background for this kind of humor is that many hackers cultivate a
fondness for conspiracy theory considered as a kind of surrealist art;
see the bibliography entry om <em>Illuminatus!</em> for the novel that launched
this trend.</p>

<h2>back door<a class="headerlink" href="#back-door" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>back door</strong>: n.</p>
<p>[common] A hole in the security of a system deliberately left in place
by designers or maintainers. The motivation for such holes is not always
sinister; some operating systems, for example, come out of the box with
privileged accounts intended for use by field service technicians or the
vendor&#8217;s maintenance programmers. Syn. <a class="reference external" href="../T/trap-door.html">trap
door</a>; may also be called a wormhole. See also

<a class="reference external" href="../W/worm.html">worm</a>, <a class="reference external" href="../L/logic-bomb.html">logic bomb</a>.</p>
<p>Historically, back doors have often lurked in systems longer than anyone
expected or planned, and a few have become widely known. Ken Thompson&#8217;s
1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM admitted the existence of a back
door in early Unix versions that may have qualified as the most
fiendishly clever security hack of all time. In this scheme, the C
compiler contained code that would recognize when the login command was
being recompiled and insert some code recognizing a password chosen by
Thompson, giving him entry to the system whether or not an account had
been created for him.</p>
<p>Normally such a back door could be removed by removing it from the
source code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler. But to
recompile the compiler, you have to <em>use</em> the compiler — so Thompson
also arranged that the compiler would <em>recognize when it was compiling a
version of itself</em>, and insert into the recompiled compiler the code to
insert into the recompiled login the code to allow Thompson entry — and,
of course, the code to recognize itself and do the whole thing again the
next time around! And having done this once, he was then able to
recompile the compiler from the original sources; the hack perpetuated
itself invisibly, leaving the back door in place and active but with no
trace in the sources.</p>
<p>The Turing lecture that reported this truly moby hack was later
published as “Reflections on Trusting Trust”, <em>Communications of the ACM
27</em>, 8 (August 1984), pp. 761&#8211;763 (text available at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.acm.org/classics/sep95/">http://www.acm.org/classics/</a>).
Ken Thompson has since confirmed that this hack was implemented and that
the Trojan Horse code did appear in the login binary of a Unix Support
group machine. Ken says the crocked compiler was never distributed. Your
editor has heard two separate reports that suggest that the crocked
login did make it out of Bell Labs, notably to BBN, and that it enabled
at least one late-night login across the network by someone using the
login name “kt”.</p>

<p>[common] To do a task in background is to do it whenever
<a class="reference external" href="../F/foreground.html">foreground</a> matters are not claiming your
undivided attention, and to background something means to relegate it to
a lower priority. “For now, we&#8217;ll just print a list of nodes and links;
I&#8217;m working on the graph-printing problem in background.” Note that this
implies ongoing activity but at a reduced level or in spare time, in
contrast to mainstream ‘back burner’ (which connotes benign neglect
until some future resumption of activity). Some people prefer to use the
term for processing that they have queued up for their unconscious minds
(a tack that one can often fruitfully take upon encountering an obstacle
in creative work). Compare <a class="reference external" href="../A/amp-off.html">amp off</a>,

also in use at Oxford, and the emphatic form “Evil and Bad and Wrong”
(abbreviated EBW) is reported from there. There are standard
abbreviations: they start with B&amp;R, a typo for “Bad and Wrong”.

<p><strong>baggy pantsing</strong>: v.</p>
<p>[Georgia Tech] A “baggy pantsing” is used to reprimand hackers who
incautiously leave their terminals unlocked. The affected user will come
back to find a post from them on internal newsgroups discussing exactly
how baggy their pants are, an accepted stand-in for “unattentive user
who left their work unprotected in the clusters”. A properly-done baggy
pantsing is highly mocking and humorous. It is considered bad form to
post a baggy pantsing to off-campus newsgroups or the more technical,
serious groups. A particularly nice baggy pantsing may be “claimed” by
immediately quoting the message in full, followed by your <a class="reference external" href="../S/sig-block.html">sig
block</a>; this has the added benefit of keeping
the embarassed victim from being able to delete the post. Interesting
baggy-pantsings have been done involving adding commands to login
scripts to repost the message every time the unlucky user logs in; Unix
boxes on the residential network, when cracked, oftentimes have their
homepages replaced (after being politely backed-up to another file) with
a baggy-pants message; .plan files are also occasionally targeted.

<p>A programming language, originally designed for Dartmouth&#8217;s experimental

leading cause of brain damage in proto-hackers. Edsger W. Dijkstra
observed in <em>Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective</em>

another case (like <a class="reference external" href="../P/Pascal.html">Pascal</a>) of the cascading

deliberately designed as an educational toy gets taken too seriously. A
novice can write short BASIC programs (on the order of 10-20 lines) very
easily; writing anything longer (a) is very painful, and (b) encourages
bad habits that will make it harder to use more powerful languages well.
This wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if historical accidents hadn&#8217;t made BASIC so

“bells, whistles, and gongs”.</p>
<p>It used to be thought that this term derived from the toyboxes on

origin, at sea. Before powered horns, ships routinely used bells,
whistles, and gongs to signal each other over longer distances than

<p><strong>beta</strong>: /bay´t&#64;/, /be´t&#64;/, /bee´t&#64;/, n.</p>
<p>1. Mostly working, but still under test; usu. used with “in”: in beta.
In the <a class="reference external" href="../R/Real-World.html">Real World</a>, hardware or software
systems often go through two stages of release testing: Alpha (in-house)
and Beta (out-house?). Beta releases are generally made to a group of
lucky (or unlucky) trusted customers.</p>
<p>2. Anything that is new and experimental. “His girlfriend is in beta”
means that he is still testing for compatibility and reserving judgment.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Flaky; dubious; suspect (since beta software is notoriously buggy).</li>
</ol>
<p>Historical note: More formally, to beta-test is to test a pre-release
(potentially unreliable) version of a piece of software by making it
available to selected (or self-selected) customers and users. This term
derives from early 1960s terminology for product cycle checkpoints,
first used at IBM but later standard throughout the industry. Alpha Test
was the unit, module, or component test phase; Beta Test was initial
system test. These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests for
hardware. The A-test was a feasibility and manufacturability evaluation
done before any commitment to design and development. The B-test was a
demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified. The
C-test (corresponding to today&#8217;s beta) was the B-test performed on early
samples of the production design, and the D test was the C test repeated
after the model had been in production a while.</p>

<p>Sense 1 may require some explanation. Most computer languages provide a

limited in size; usually they must be smaller than <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">231</span></tt>

have to use floating-point numbers, which are usually accurate to only
six or seven decimal places. Computer languages that provide bignums can
perform exact calculations on very large numbers, such as 1000! (the
factorial of 1000, which is 1000 times 999 times 998 times ... times 2
times 1). For example, this value for 1000! was computed by the MacLISP
system using bignums:</p>

<p>This term is used purely in jest. It is based on the fanciful notion
that bits are objects that are not destroyed but only misplaced. This
appears to have been a mutation of an earlier term ‘bit box’, about
which the same legend was current; old-time hackers also report that
trainees used to be told that when the CPU stored bits into memory it

<p>Another variant of this legend has it that, as a consequence of the

filling up the bit bucket. A qualified computer technician can empty a
full bit bucket as part of scheduled maintenance.</p>

<div class="section" id="bit-paired-keyboard">
<h2>bit-paired keyboard<a class="headerlink" href="#bit-paired-keyboard" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>bit-paired keyboard</strong>: n.,obs.</p>
<p>(alt.: bit-shift keyboard) A non-standard keyboard layout that seems to
have originated with the Teletype ASR-33 and remained common for several
years on early computer equipment. The ASR-33 was a mechanical device
(see <a class="reference external" href="../E/EOU.html">EOU</a>), so the only way to generate the
character codes from keystrokes was by some physical linkage. The design
of the ASR-33 assigned each character key a basic pattern that could be
modified by flipping bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL key was pressed. In
order to avoid making the thing even more of a kluge than it already
was, the design had to group characters that shared the same basic bit
pattern on one key.</p>
<p>Looking at the ASCII chart, we find:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>high  low bits
bits  0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001
 010        !    &quot;    #    $    %    &amp;    &#39;    (    )
 011   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is why the characters !&#8221;#$%&amp;&#8217;() appear where they do on a Teletype
(thankfully, they didn&#8217;t use shift-0 for space). The Teletype Model 33
was actually designed before ASCII existed, and was originally intended
to use a code that contained these two rows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>      low bits
high  0000  0010  0100  0110  1000  1010  1100  1110
bits     0001  0011  0101  0111  1001  1011  1101  1111
  10   )  ! bel #  $  % wru &amp;  *  (  &quot;  :  ?  _  ,   .
  11   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  &#39;  ;  /  - esc del              |
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The result would have been something closer to a normal keyboard. But as
it happened, Teletype had to use a lot of persuasion just to keep ASCII,
and the Model 33 keyboard, from looking like this instead:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>   !  &quot;  ?  $  &#39;  &amp;  -  (  )  ;  :  *  /  ,  .
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  +  ~  &lt;  &gt;  ×  |
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Teletype&#8217;s was <em>not</em> the weirdest variant of the
<a class="reference external" href="../Q/QWERTY.html">QWERTY</a> layout widely seen, by the way; that
prize should probably go to one of several (differing) arrangements on
IBM&#8217;s even clunkier 026 and 029 card punches.</p>
<p>When electronic terminals became popular, in the early 1970s, there was
no agreement in the industry over how the keyboards should be laid out.
Some vendors opted to emulate the Teletype keyboard, while others used
the flexibility of electronic circuitry to make their product look like
an office typewriter. Either choice was supported by the ANSI computer
keyboard standard, X4.14-1971, which referred to the alternatives as
“logical bit pairing” and “typewriter pairing”. These alternatives
became known as bit-paired and typewriter-paired keyboards. To a hacker,
the bit-paired keyboard seemed far more logical — and because most
hackers in those days had never learned to touch-type, there was little
pressure from the pioneering users to adapt keyboards to the typewriter
standard.</p>
<p>The doom of the bit-paired keyboard was the large-scale introduction of
the computer terminal into the normal office environment, where
out-and-out technophobes were expected to use the equipment. The
typewriter-paired standard became universal, X4.14 was superseded by
X4.23-1982, bit-paired hardware was quickly junked or relegated to dusty
corners, and both terms passed into disuse.</p>
<p>However, in countries without a long history of touch typing, the
argument against the bit-paired keyboard layout was weak or nonexistent.
As a result, the standard Japanese keyboard, used on PCs, Unix boxen
etc. still has all of the !&#8221;#$%&amp;&#8217;() characters above the numbers in the
ASR-33 layout.</p>

<p><strong>bit rot</strong>: n.</p>
<p>[common] Also <a class="reference external" href="bit-decay.html">bit decay</a>. Hypothetical disease the
existence of which has been deduced from the observation that unused
programs or features will often stop working after sufficient time has

file or the code in a program will become increasingly garbled.</p>
<p>There actually are physical processes that produce such effects (alpha
particles generated by trace radionuclides in ceramic chip packages, for
example, can change the contents of a computer memory unpredictably, and
various kinds of subtle media failures can corrupt files in mass
storage), but they are quite rare (and computers are built with
error-detecting circuitry to compensate for them). The notion long

<h2>blinkenlights<a class="headerlink" href="#blinkenlights" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>blinkenlights</strong>: /blink&#8217;&#64;n·li:tz/, n.</p>
<p>[common] Front-panel diagnostic lights on a computer, esp. a
<a class="reference external" href="../D/dinosaur.html">dinosaur</a>. Now that dinosaurs are rare, this
term usually refers to status lights on a modem, network hub, or the
like.</p>
<p>This term derives from the last word of the famous blackletter-Gothic
sign in mangled pseudo-German that once graced about half the computer
rooms in the English-speaking world. One version ran in its entirety as
follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>                  ACHTUNG!  ALLES LOOKENSPEEPERS!

<p>This silliness dates back at least as far as 1955 at IBM and had already
gone international by the early 1960s, when it was reported at London
University&#8217;s ATLAS computing site. There are several variants of it in
circulation, some of which actually do end with the word
‘blinkenlights’.</p>
<p>In an amusing example of turnabout-is-fair-play, German hackers have
developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster in fractured
English, one of which is reproduced here:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>                              ATTENTION

<p>Old-time hackers sometimes get nostalgic for blinkenlights because they
were so much more fun to look at than a blank panel. Sadly, very few
computers still have them (the three LEDs on a PC keyboard certainly
don&#8217;t count). The obvious reasons (cost of wiring, cost of front-panel
cutouts, almost nobody needs or wants to interpret machine-register
states on the fly anymore) are only part of the story. Another part of
it is that radio-frequency leakage from the lamp wiring was beginning to
be a problem as far back as transistor machines. But the most
fundamental fact is that there are very few signals slow enough to blink
an LED these days! With slow CPUs, you could watch the bus register or
instruction counter tick, but even at 33/66/150MHz (let alone gigahertz
speeds) it&#8217;s all a blur.</p>
<p>Despite this, a couple of relatively recent computer designs of note
have featured programmable blinkenlights that were added just because
they looked cool. The Connection Machine, a 65,536-processor parallel
computer designed in the mid-1980s, was a black cube with one side
covered with a grid of red blinkenlights; the sales demo had them
evolving <a class="reference external" href="../L/life.html">life</a> patterns. A few years later the
ill-fated BeBox (a personal computer designed to run the BeOS operating
system) featured twin rows of blinkenlights on the case front. When Be,
Inc. decided to get out of the hardware business in 1996 and instead
ported their OS to the PowerPC and later to the Intel architecture, many
users suffered severely from the absence of their beloved blinkenlights.
Before long an external version of the blinkenlights driven by a PC
serial port became available; there is some sort of plot symmetry in the
fact that it was assembled by a German.</p>
<p>Finally, a version updated for the Internet has been seen on
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">news.admin.net-abuse.email</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>                   ACHTUNG! ALLES LOOKENSPEEPERS!

<p>This newest version partly reflects reports that the word
‘blinkenlights’ is (in 1999) undergoing something of a revival in usage,
but applied to networking equipment. The transmit and receive lights on
routers, activity lights on switches and hubs, and other network
equipment often blink in visually pleasing and seemingly coordinated
ways. Although this is different in some ways from register readings, a
tall stack of Cisco equipment or a 19-inch rack of ISDN terminals can
provoke a similar feeling of hypnotic awe, especially in a darkened
network operations center or server room.</p>
<p>The ancestor of the original blinkenlights posters of the 1950s was
probably this:</p>
<img alt="../_images/gefingerpoken.jpg" src="../_images/gefingerpoken.jpg" />
<p>WWII-era machine-shop poster</p>
<p>We are informed that cod-German parodies of this kind were very common
in Allied machine shops during and following WWII. Germans, then as now,
had a reputation for being both good with precision machinery and prone
to officious notices.</p>

followed by a last name followed by an optional jr-part (Jr., Sr., or
dynastic number) and end-of-line, or a personal part followed by a name
part (this rule illustrates the use of recursion in BNFs, covering the
case of people who use multiple first and middle names and/or initials).
A street address consists of an optional apartment specifier, followed

from “Brother Of <a class="reference external" href="BOFH.html">BOFH</a>”, though all parties agree it
could have been. Rather, it was triggered by an unusually large draft of
new tech-support people in 1995. It was observed that there would be
much duplication of names. To ease the confusion, it was decided that
all support techs would henceforth be known as “Bob”, and identity
badges were created labelled “Bob 1” and “Bob 2”. (“No, we never got any
further” reports a witness).</p>
<p>The reason for “Bob” rather than anything else is due to a
<a class="reference external" href="../L/luser.html">luser</a> calling and asking to speak to “Bob”,
despite the fact that no “Bob” was currently working for Tech Support.
Since we all know “the customer is always right”, it was decided that
there had to be at least one “Bob” on duty at all times, just in case.</p>
<p>This sillyness snowballed inexorably. Shift leaders and managers began
to refer to their groups of “bobs”. Whole ranks of support machines were
set up (and still exist in the DNS as of 1999) as bob1 through bobN.
Then came <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">alt.tech-support.recovery</span></tt>, and it was filled with Demon

awfulness. Looking at a program and seeing a dumb algorithm, one might

<p>A spectacular variant of bogo-sort has been proposed which has the

time. (In the Many-Worlds model, the result of any quantum action is to
split the universe-before into a sheaf of universes-after, one for each
possible way the state vector can collapse; in any one of the
universes-after the result appears random.) The steps are: 1. Permute
the array randomly using a quantum process, 2. If the array is not
sorted, destroy the universe (checking that the list is sorted requires
O(n) time). Implementation of step 2 is left as an exercise for the
reader.</p>

Shamos, a migratory Princeton alumnus. A glossary of bogus words was
compiled at Yale when the word was first popularized there about
1975-76. These coinages spread into hackerdom from CMU and MIT. Most of
them remained wordplay objects rather than actual vocabulary items or
live metaphors. Examples: amboguous (having multiple bogus
interpretations); bogotissimo (in a gloriously bogus manner);
bogotophile (one who is pathologically fascinated by the bogus);
paleobogology (the study of primeval bogosity).</p>

uses of bogus grate on British nerves; in Britain the word means, rather

exchange: “You&#8217;ve lost me.” “OK, reboot. Here&#8217;s the theory....”</p>
<p>This term is also found in the variants cold boot (from power-off
condition) and warm boot (with the CPU and all devices already powered
up, as after a hardware reset or software crash).</p>
<p>Another variant: soft boot, reinitialization of only part of a system,
under control of other software still running: “If you&#8217;re running the
<a class="reference external" href="../M/mess-dos.html">mess-dos</a> emulator, control-alt-insert will
cause a soft-boot of the emulator, while leaving the rest of the system
running.”</p>
<p>Opposed to this there is hard boot, which connotes hostility towards or
frustration with the machine being booted: “I&#8217;ll have to hard-boot this
losing Sun.” “I recommend booting it hard.” One often hard-boots by
performing a <a class="reference external" href="../P/power-cycle.html">power cycle</a>.</p>
<p>Historical note: this term derives from bootstrap loader, a short
program that was read in from cards or paper tape, or toggled in from
the front panel switches. This program was always very short (great
efforts were expended on making it short in order to minimize the labor
and chance of error involved in toggling it in), but was just smart
enough to read in a slightly more complex program (usually from a card
or paper tape reader), to which it handed control; this program in turn
was smart enough to read the application or operating system from a
magnetic tape drive or disk drive. Thus, in successive steps, the
computer ‘pulled itself up by its bootstraps’ to a useful operating
state. Nowadays the bootstrap is usually found in ROM or EPROM, and
reads the first stage in from a fixed location on the disk, called the
‘boot block’. When this program gains control, it is powerful enough to
load the actual OS and hand control over to it.</p>

Microsoft is not a daily reality, the Borg is sometimes Cisco. This

bottom-up implementations; a more sophisticated response is middle-out

newsgroups to which the article is posted. The Breidbart Index is the
sum of the square roots of all of the posts in the spam. For example,
one article posted to nine newsgroups and again to sixteen would have BI

<p><strong>brute force</strong>: adj.</p>
<p>Describes a primitive programming style, one in which the programmer
relies on the computer&#8217;s processing power instead of using his or her
own intelligence to simplify the problem, often ignoring problems of
scale and applying naive methods suited to small problems directly to
large ones. The term can also be used in reference to programming style:

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="../C/canonical.html">canonical</a> example of a brute-force
algorithm is associated with the ‘traveling salesman problem’ (TSP), a
classical <a class="reference external" href="../N/NP-.html">NP-</a>hard problem: Suppose a person is
in, say, Boston, and wishes to drive to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N</span></tt> other cities. In what
order should the cities be visited in order to minimize the distance
travelled? The brute-force method is to simply generate all possible
routes and compare the distances; while guaranteed to work and simple to
implement, this algorithm is clearly very stupid in that it considers
even obviously absurd routes (like going from Boston to Houston via San
Francisco and New York, in that order). For very small <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N</span></tt> it works
well, but it rapidly becomes absurdly inefficient when <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N</span></tt> increases
(for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N</span> <span class="pre">=</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="pre">15</span></tt>, there are already 1,307,674,368,000 possible routes

<p>A more simple-minded example of brute-force programming is finding the
smallest number in a large list by first using an existing program to
sort the list in ascending order, and then picking the first number off
the front.</p>
<p>Whether brute-force programming should actually be considered stupid or
not depends on the context; if the problem is not terribly big, the
extra CPU time spent on a brute-force solution may cost less than the
programmer time it would take to develop a more ‘intelligent’ algorithm.
Additionally, a more intelligent algorithm may imply more long-term
complexity cost and bug-chasing than are justified by the speed
improvement.</p>
<p>Ken Thompson, co-inventor of Unix, is reported to have uttered the
epigram “When in doubt, use brute force”. He probably intended this as a

<p>Historical note: Admiral Grace Hopper (an early computing pioneer better
known for inventing <a class="reference external" href="../C/COBOL.html">COBOL</a>) liked to tell a story
in which a technician solved a <a class="reference external" href="../G/glitch.html">glitch</a> in the
Harvard Mark II machine by pulling an actual insect out from between the
contacts of one of its relays, and she subsequently promulgated
<a class="reference external" href="bug.html">bug</a> in its hackish sense as a joke about the incident
(though, as she was careful to admit, she was not there when it
happened). For many years the logbook associated with the incident and
the actual bug in question (a moth) sat in a display case at the Naval
Surface Warfare Center (NSWC). The entire story, with a picture of the
logbook and the moth taped into it, is recorded in the <em>Annals of the
History of Computing</em>, Vol. 3, No. 3 (July 1981), pp. 285&#8211;286.</p>
<p>The text of the log entry (from September 9, 1947), reads “1545 Relay
#70 Panel F (moth) in relay. First actual case of bug being found”. This
wording establishes that the term was already in use at the time in its
current specific sense — and Hopper herself reports that the term bug
was regularly applied to problems in radar electronics during WWII.</p>
<p><img alt="image0" src="concordance/../graphics/bugpic-color.jpg" /></p>
<p>The ‘original bug’ (the caption date is incorrect)</p>
<p>Indeed, the use of bug to mean an industrial defect was already
established in Thomas Edison&#8217;s time, and a more specific and rather
modern use can be found in an electrical handbook from 1896 (<em>Hawkin&#8217;s
New Catechism of Electricity</em>, Theo. Audel &amp; Co.) which says: “The term
‘bug’ is used to a limited extent to designate any fault or trouble in
the connections or working of electric apparatus.” It further notes that
the term is “said to have originated in quadruplex telegraphy and have
been transferred to all electric apparatus.”</p>
<p>The latter observation may explain a common folk etymology of the term;
that it came from telephone company usage, in which “bugs in a telephone
cable” were blamed for noisy lines. Though this derivation seems to be
mistaken, it may well be a distorted memory of a joke first current
among <em>telegraph</em> operators more than a century ago!</p>
<p>Or perhaps not a joke. Historians of the field inform us that the term
“bug” was regularly used in the early days of telegraphy to refer to a
variety of semi-automatic telegraphy keyers that would send a string of
dots if you held them down. In fact, the Vibroplex keyers (which were
among the most common of this type) even had a graphic of a beetle on
them (and still do)! While the ability to send repeated dots
automatically was very useful for professional morse code operators,
these were also significantly trickier to use than the older manual
keyers, and it could take some practice to ensure one didn&#8217;t introduce
extraneous dots into the code by holding the key down a fraction too
long. In the hands of an inexperienced operator, a Vibroplex “bug” on
the line could mean that a lot of garbled Morse would soon be coming
your way.</p>
<p>Further, the term “bug” has long been used among radio technicians to
describe a device that converts electromagnetic field variations into
acoustic signals. It is used to trace radio interference and look for
dangerous radio emissions. Radio community usage derives from the
roach-like shape of the first versions used by 19th century physicists.
The first versions consisted of a coil of wire (roach body), with the
two wire ends sticking out and bent back to nearly touch forming a spark
gap (roach antennae). The bug is to the radio technician what the
stethoscope is to the stereotypical medical doctor. This sense is almost
certainly ancestral to modern use of “bug” for a covert monitoring
device, but may also have contributed to the use of “bug” for the
effects of radio interference itself.</p>
<p>Actually, use of bug in the general sense of a disruptive event goes
back to Shakespeare! (Henry VI, part III - Act V, Scene II: King Edward:
“So, lie thou there. Die thou; and die our fear; For Warwick was a bug
that fear&#8217;d us all.”) In the first edition of Samuel Johnson&#8217;s
dictionary one meaning of bug is “A frightful object; a walking
spectre”; this is traced to ‘bugbear’, a Welsh term for a variety of
mythological monster which (to complete the circle) has recently been
reintroduced into the popular lexicon through fantasy role-playing
games.</p>
<p>In any case, in jargon the word almost never refers to insects. Here is
a plausible conversation that never actually happened: “There is a bug
in this ant farm!” “What do you mean? I don&#8217;t see any ants in it.”
“That&#8217;s the bug.”</p>
<p>A careful discussion of the etymological issues can be found in a paper
by Fred R. Shapiro, 1987, “Entomology of the Computer Bug: History and
Folklore”, American Speech 62(4):376-378.</p>
<p>[There has been a widespread myth that the original bug was moved to the
Smithsonian, and an earlier version of this entry so asserted. A
correspondent who thought to check discovered that the bug was not
there. While investigating this in late 1990, your editor discovered
that the NSWC still had the bug, but had unsuccessfully tried to get the
Smithsonian to accept it — and that the present curator of their History
of American Technology Museum didn&#8217;t know this and agreed that it would
make a worthwhile exhibit. It was moved to the Smithsonian in mid-1991,
but due to space and money constraints was not actually exhibited for
years afterwards. Thus, the process of investigating the
original-computer-bug bug fixed it in an entirely unexpected way, by
making the myth true! —ESR]</p>

<p><strong>burn a CD</strong>: v.</p>
<p>To write a software or document distribution on a CDR. Coined from the
fact that a laser is used to inscribe the information by burning small
pits in the medium, and from the fact that disk comes out of the drive
warm to the touch. Writable CDs can be done on a normal desk-top machine
with a suitable drive (so there is no protracted release cycle
associated with making them) but each one takes a long time to make, so
they are not appropriate for volume production. Writable CDs are
suitable for software backups and for short-turnaround-time low-volume
software distribution, such as sending a beta release version to a few
selected field test sites. Compare <a class="reference external" href="../C/cut-a-tape.html">cut a

<p><strong>busy-wait</strong>: vi.</p>
<p>Used of human behavior, conveys that the subject is busy waiting for
someone or something, intends to move instantly as soon as it shows up,
and thus cannot do anything else at the moment. “Can&#8217;t talk now, I&#8217;m

<p>Technically, busy-wait means to wait on an event by
<a class="reference external" href="../S/spin.html">spin</a>ning through a tight or timed-delay loop
that polls for the event on each pass, as opposed to setting up an
interrupt handler and continuing execution on another part of the task.

<p>1. [common] Said of an operation (especially a repetitive, trivial,

computer, but which a hacker instead has to step tediously through. “My
mailer doesn&#8217;t have a command to include the text of the message I&#8217;m

the speaker has to retype a copy of the message; it might refer to, say,
dropping into a subshell from the mailer, making a copy of one&#8217;s mailbox
file, reading that into an editor, locating the top and bottom of the
message in question, deleting the rest of the file, inserting `&gt;&#8217;

<div class="section" id="byte">
<h2>byte<a class="headerlink" href="#byte" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>byte</strong>: /bi:t/, n.</p>
<p>[techspeak] A unit of memory or data equal to the amount used to
represent one character; on modern architectures this is invariably 8
bits. Some older architectures used byte for quantities of 6, 7, or
(especially) 9 bits, and the PDP-10 supported bytes that were actually
bitfields of 1 to 36 bits! These usages are now obsolete, killed off by
universal adoption of power-of-2 word sizes.</p>
<p>Historical note: The term was coined by Werner Buchholz in 1956 during
the early design phase for the IBM Stretch computer; originally it was
described as 1 to 6 bits (typical I/O equipment of the period used 6-bit
chunks of information). The move to an 8-bit byte happened in late 1956,
and this size was later adopted and promulgated as a standard by the
System/360. The word was coined by mutating the word ‘bite’ so it would
not be accidentally misspelled as <a class="reference external" href="bit.html">bit</a>. See also
