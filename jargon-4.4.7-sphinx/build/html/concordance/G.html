<p>Garbage collection is computer-science techspeak for a particular class
of strategies for dynamically but transparently reallocating computer
memory (i.e., without requiring explicit allocation and deallocation by
higher-level software). One such strategy involves periodically scanning
all the data in memory and determining what is no longer accessible;
useless data items are then discarded so that the memory they occupy can
be recycled and used for another purpose. Implementations of the LISP
language usually use garbage collection.</p>
<p>In jargon, the full phrase is sometimes heard but the
<a class="reference external" href="../A/abbrev.html">abbrev</a> GC is more frequently used because it is
shorter. Note that there is an ambiguity in usage that has to be
resolved by context: “I&#8217;m going to garbage-collect my desk” usually
means to clean out the drawers, but it could also mean to throw away or
recycle the desk itself.</p>

<p>A <a class="reference external" href="../Q/quick-and-dirty.html">quick-and-dirty</a>
<a class="reference external" href="../C/clone.html">clone</a> of System/360 DOS that emerged from GE
around 1970; originally called GECOS (the General Electric Comprehensive
Operating System). Later kluged to support primitive timesharing and
transaction processing. After the buyout of GE&#8217;s computer division by
Honeywell, the name was changed to General Comprehensive Operating
System (GCOS). Other OS groups at Honeywell began referring to it as
‘God&#8217;s Chosen Operating System’, allegedly in reaction to the GCOS
crowd&#8217;s uninformed and snotty attitude about the superiority of their
product. All this might be of zero interest, except for two facts: (1)
The GCOS people won the political war, and this led in the orphaning and
eventual death of Honeywell <a class="reference external" href="../M/Multics.html">Multics</a>, and (2)
GECOS/GCOS left one permanent mark on Unix. Some early Unix systems at
Bell Labs used GCOS machines for print spooling and various other
services; the field added to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/etc/passwd</span></tt> to carry GCOS ID
information was called the GECOS field and survives today as the

dismal also-ran in the mainframe market, and was itself mostly ditched

<p><strong>gedanken</strong>: /g&#64;·dahn´kn/, adj.</p>
<p>Ungrounded; impractical; not well-thought-out; untried; untested.</p>
<p>‘Gedanken’ is a German word for ‘thought’. A thought experiment is one
you carry out in your head. In physics, the term <em>gedanken experiment</em>
is used to refer to an experiment that is impractical to carry out, but
useful to consider because it can be reasoned about theoretically. (A
classic gedanken experiment of relativity theory involves thinking about
a man in an elevator accelerating through space.) Gedanken experiments
are very useful in physics, but must be used with care. It&#8217;s too easy to
idealize away some important aspect of the real world in constructing
the ‘apparatus’.</p>
<p>Among hackers, accordingly, the word has a pejorative connotation. It is
typically used of a project, especially one in artificial intelligence
research, that is written up in grand detail (typically as a Ph.D.
thesis) without ever being implemented to any great extent. Such a
project is usually perpetrated by people who aren&#8217;t very good hackers or
find programming distasteful or are just in a hurry. A gedanken thesis
is usually marked by an obvious lack of intuition about what is
programmable and what is not, and about what does and does not
constitute a clear specification of an algorithm. See also

mainstream social acceptance. Geeks usually have a strong case of
<a class="reference external" href="../N/neophilia.html">neophilia</a>. Most geeks are adept with
computers and treat <a class="reference external" href="../H/hacker.html">hacker</a> as a term of
respect, but not all are hackers themselves — and some who <em>are</em> in fact
hackers normally call themselves geeks anyway, because they (quite
properly) regard ‘hacker’ as a label that should be bestowed by others
rather than self-assumed.</p>
<p>One <a class="reference external" href="http://www.darkwater.com/omni/geek.html">description</a> accurately
if a little breathlessly enumerates “gamers, ravers, science fiction
fans, punks, perverts, programmers, nerds, subgenii, and trekkies. These
are people who did not go to their high school proms, and many would be
offended by the suggestion that they should have even wanted to.”</p>
<p>Originally, a geek was a carnival performer who bit the heads off
chickens. (In early 20th-century Scotland a ‘geek’ was an immature
coley, a type of fish.) Before about 1990 usage of this term was rather
negative. Earlier versions of this lexicon defined a computer geek as
one who eats (computer) bugs for a living — an asocial, malodorous,
pasty-faced monomaniac with all the personality of a cheese grater. This
is often still the way geeks are regarded by non-geeks, but as the
mainstream culture becomes more dependent on technology and technical
skill mainstream attitudes have tended to shift towards grudging
respect. Correspondingly, there are now ‘geek pride’ festivals (the
implied reference to ‘gay pride’ is not accidental).</p>

Foundation&#8217;s official position is that copyright law limits the scope of

names that were acronyms beginning with the word “GNU”, such as “GNU C
Compiler” (gcc) and “GNU Debugger” (gdb), and this launched a tradition.
Just as many Java developers will begin their projects with J, many free
software developers will begin theirs with G. It is often the case that
a program with a G-prefixed name is licensed under the GNU GPL.</p>
<p>For example, someone may write a free Enterprise Engineering Kludge
package (EEK technology is all the rage in the technical journals) and
name it “geek” to imply that it is a GPL&#8217;d EEK package.</p>

<p><strong>gopher</strong>: n.</p>
<p>[obs.] A type of Internet service first floated around 1991 and
obsolesced around 1995 by the World Wide Web. Gopher presents a menuing
interface to a tree or graph of links; the links can be to documents,
runnable programs, or other gopher menus arbitrarily far across the net.</p>
<p>Some claim that the gopher software, which was originally developed at
the University of Minnesota, was named after the Minnesota Gophers (a
sports team). Others claim the word derives from American slang gofer
(from “go for”, dialectal “go fer”), one whose job is to run and fetch
things. Finally, observe that gophers dig long tunnels, and the idea of
tunneling through the net to find information was a defining metaphor
for the developers. Probably all three things were true, but with the
first two coming first and the gopher-tunnel metaphor serendipitously
adding flavor and impetus to the project as it developed out of its
concept stage.</p>

<p>A mythical accessory to a terminal. A crank on the side of a monitor,

<p>Historical note: At least one real machine actually had a grind crank —
the R1, a research machine built toward the end of the days of the great
vacuum tube computers, in 1959. R1 (also known as ‘The Rice Institute
Computer’ (TRIC) and later as ‘The Rice University Computer’ (TRUC)) had
a single-step/free-run switch for use when debugging programs. Since
single-stepping through a large program was rather tedious, there was
also a crank with a cam and gear arrangement that repeatedly pushed the
single-step button. This allowed one to ‘crank’ through a lot of code,
then slow down to single-step for a bit when you got near the code of
interest, poke at some registers using the console typewriter, and then
keep on cranking. See

groveling through the /usr directories for 10 minutes now.” Compare
<a class="reference external" href="grind.html">grind</a> and <a class="reference external" href="../C/crunch.html">crunch</a>. Emphatic
form: grovel obscenely.</p>
<p>2. To examine minutely or in complete detail. “The compiler grovels over
the entire source program before beginning to translate it.” “I
grovelled through all the documentation, but I still couldn&#8217;t find the
command I wanted.”</p>

<h2>grue<a class="headerlink" href="#grue" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>grue</strong>: n.</p>
<p>[from archaic English verb for shudder, as with fear] The grue was
originated in the game <a class="reference external" href="../Z/Zork.html">Zork</a> (Dave Lebling took
the name from Jack Vance&#8217;s <em>Dying Earth</em> fantasies) and used in several
other <a class="reference external" href="../I/Infocom.html">Infocom</a> games as a hint that you should
perhaps look for a lamp, torch or some type of light source. Wandering
into a dark area would cause the game to prompt you, “It is very dark.
If you continue you are likely to be eaten by a grue.” If you failed to
locate a light source within the next couple of moves this would indeed
be the case.</p>
<p>The grue, according to scholars of the Great Underground Empire, is a
sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth. Its favorite
diet is either adventurers or enchanters, but its insatiable appetite is
tempered by its extreme fear of light. No grues have ever been seen by
the light of day, and only a few have been observed in their underground
lairs. Of those who have seen grues, few have survived their fearsome
jaws to tell the tale. Grues have sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed
faces, sharp claws and fangs, and an uncontrollable tendency to slaver
and gurgle. They are certainly the most evil-tempered of all creatures;
to say they are touchy is a dangerous understatement. “Sour as a grue”
is a common expression, even among grues themselves.</p>
<p>All this folklore is widely known among hackers.</p>

<h2>guru meditation<a class="headerlink" href="#guru-meditation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>guru meditation</strong>: n.</p>
<p>Amiga equivalent of panic in Unix (sometimes just called a guru or guru
event). When the system crashes, a cryptic message of the form “GURU
MEDITATION #XXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYY” may appear, indicating what the problem
was. An Amiga guru can figure things out from the numbers. Sometimes a
<a class="reference external" href="guru.html">guru</a> event must be followed by a <a class="reference external" href="../V/Vulcan-nerve-pinch.html">Vulcan nerve
pinch</a>.</p>
<p>This term is (no surprise) an in-joke from the earliest days of the
Amiga. An earlier product of the Amiga corporation was a device called a
‘Joyboard’ which was basically a plastic board built onto a
joystick-like device; it was sold with a skiing game cartridge for the
Atari game machine. It is said that whenever the prototype OS crashed,
the system programmer responsible would calm down by concentrating on a
solution while sitting cross-legged on a Joyboard trying to keep the
board in balance. This position resembled that of a meditating guru.
Sadly, the joke was removed fairly early on (but there&#8217;s a well-known
patch to restore it in more recent versions).</p>

<h2>gweep<a class="headerlink" href="#gweep" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>gweep</strong>: /gweep/</p>
<p>[WPI]</p>
<p>1. v. To <a class="reference external" href="../H/hack.html">hack</a>, usually at night. At WPI, from
1975 onwards, one who gweeped could often be found at the College
Computing Center punching cards or crashing the
<a class="reference external" href="../P/PDP-10.html">PDP-10</a> or, later, the DEC-20. A correspondent
who was there at the time opines that the term was originally
onomatopoetic, describing the keyclick sound of the Datapoint terminals
long connected to the PDP-10; others allege that ‘gweep’ was the sound
of the Datapoint&#8217;s bell (compare <a class="reference external" href="../F/feep.html">feep</a>). The term
has survived the demise of those technologies, however, and was still
alive in early 1999. “I&#8217;m going to go gweep for a while. See you in the
morning.” “I gweep from 8 PM till 3 AM during the week.”</p>
<p>2. n. One who habitually gweeps in sense 1; a
<a class="reference external" href="../H/hacker.html">hacker</a>. “He&#8217;s a hard-core gweep, mumbles code
in his sleep.” Around 1979 this was considered derogatory and not used
in self-reference; it has since been proudly claimed in much the same
way as <a class="reference external" href="geek.html">geek</a>.</p>
