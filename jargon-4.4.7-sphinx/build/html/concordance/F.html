<h2>fall through<a class="headerlink" href="#fall-through" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>fall through</strong>: v.</p>
<p>(n. fallthrough, var.: fall-through)</p>
<p>1. To exit a loop by exhaustion, i.e., by having fulfilled its exit
condition rather than via a break or exception condition that exits from
the middle of it. This usage appears to be <em>really</em> old, dating from the
1940s and 1950s.</p>
<p>2. To fail a test that would have passed control to a subroutine or some
other distant portion of code.</p>
<p>3. In C, ‘fall-through’ occurs when the flow of execution in a switch
statement reaches a <strong>case</strong> label other than by jumping there from the
switch header, passing a point where one would normally expect to find a
<strong>break</strong>. A trivial example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>switch (color)
{
case GREEN:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>do_green();
break;</div></blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>case PINK:</dt>
<dd>do_pink();
/* FALL THROUGH */</dd>
<dt>case RED:</dt>
<dd>do_red();
break;</dd>
<dt>default:</dt>
<dd>do_blue();
break;</dd>
</dl>
<p>}</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The variant spelling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/*</span> <span class="pre">FALL</span> <span class="pre">THRU</span> <span class="pre">*/</span></tt> is also common.</p>
<p>The effect of the above code is to do_green() when color is <strong>GREEN</strong>,
do_red() when color is <strong>RED</strong>, do_blue() on any other color other
than <strong>PINK</strong>, and (and this is the important part) do_pink() <em>and
then</em> do_red() when color is <strong>PINK</strong>. Fall-through is <a class="reference external" href="../C/considered-harmful.html">considered
harmful</a> by some, though there are
contexts (such as the coding of state machines) in which it is natural;
it is generally considered good practice to include a comment
highlighting the fall-through where one would normally expect a break.

<p><strong>fat electrons</strong>: n.</p>
<p>Old-time hacker David Cargill&#8217;s theory on the causation of computer
glitches. Your typical electric utility draws its line current out of
the big generators with a pair of coil taps located near the top of the
dynamo. When the normal tap brushes get dirty, they take them off line
to clean them up, and use special auxiliary taps on the <em>bottom</em> of the
coil. Now, this is a problem, because when they do that they get not
ordinary or ‘thin’ electrons, but the fat&#8217;n&#8217;sloppy electrons that are
heavier and so settle to the bottom of the generator. These flow down
ordinary wires just fine, but when they have to turn a sharp corner (as
in an integrated-circuit via), they&#8217;re apt to get stuck. This is what
causes computer glitches. [Fascinating. Obviously, fat electrons must

<p>The act of removing a feature from a program. Featurectomies come in two
flavors, the righteous and the reluctant. Righteous featurectomies are
performed because the remover believes the program would be more elegant
without the feature, or there is already an equivalent and better way to

be turned into a <a class="reference external" href="feature.html">feature</a> simply by documenting it
(then theoretically no one can complain about it because it&#8217;s in the

built around the window behind you, and the route has to be kept clear.”</p>
<p>A: “Oh. Then it&#8217;s a misfeature; they should have increased the spacing
between rows here.”</p>
<p>B: “Yes. But if they&#8217;d increased spacing in only one section it would
have been a wart — they would&#8217;ve had to make nonstandard-length ceiling
panels to fit over the displaced seats.”</p>
<p>A: “A miswart, actually. If they increased spacing throughout they&#8217;d
lose several rows and a chunk out of the profit margin. So unequal
spacing would actually be the Right Thing.”</p>
<p>B: “Indeed.”</p>

<p>Many people have been mystified by the cloverleaf-like symbol that
appears on the feature key. Its oldest name is ‘cross of St. Hannes’,
but it occurs in pre-Christian Viking art as a decorative motif.
Throughout Scandinavia today the road agencies use it to mark sites of
historical interest. Apple picked up the symbol from an early Mac
developer who happened to be Swedish. Apple documentation gives the
translation “interesting feature”!</p>
<p>There is some dispute as to the proper (Swedish) name of this symbol. It
technically stands for the word <em>sevärdhet</em> (thing worth seeing); many
of these are old churches. Some Swedes report as an idiom for the sign
the word kyrka, cognate to English ‘church’ and pronounced (roughly)
/chur´ka/ in modern Swedish. Others say this is nonsense. Other idioms
reported for the sign are <em>runa</em> (rune) or runsten /roon´stn/
(runestone), derived from the fact that many of the interesting features
are Viking rune-stones. The term <em>fornminne</em> /foorn´min&#8217;&#64;/ (relic of
antiquity, ancient monument) is also reported, especially among those
who think that the Mac itself is a relic of antiquity.</p>

system or program in question has become a misshapen creature of hacks.

<p>If someone tells you about some new improvement to a program, you might
respond: “Feetch, feetch!” The meaning of this depends critically on
vocal inflection. With enthusiasm, it means something like “Boy, that&#8217;s
great! What a great hack!” Grudgingly or with obvious doubt, it means “I

<h2>fence<a class="headerlink" href="#fence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>fence</strong></p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="14">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>1. A sequence of one or more distinguished
(<a class="reference external" href="../O/out-of-band.html">out-of-band</a>) characters (or other data
items), used to delimit a piece of data intended to be treated as a unit
(the computer-science literature calls this a sentinel). The NUL (ASCII
0000000) character that terminates strings in C is a fence. Hex FF is
also (though slightly less frequently) used this way. See
<a class="reference external" href="../Z/zigamorph.html">zigamorph</a>.</p>
<p>2. An extra data value inserted in an array or other data structure in
order to allow some normal test on the array&#8217;s contents also to function
as a termination test. For example, a highly optimized routine for
finding a value in an array might artificially place a copy of the value
to be searched for after the last slot of the array, thus allowing the
main search loop to search for the value without having to check at each
pass whether the end of the array had been reached.</p>
<p>3. [among users of optimizing compilers] Any technique, usually
exploiting knowledge about the compiler, that blocks certain
optimizations. Used when explicit mechanisms are not available or are
overkill. Typically a hack: “I call a dummy procedure there to force a
flush of the optimizer&#8217;s register-coloring info” can be expressed by the
shorter “That&#8217;s a fence procedure”.</p>

<div class="section" id="fencepost-error">
<h2>fencepost error<a class="headerlink" href="#fencepost-error" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>fencepost error</strong>: n.</p>
<p>1. [common] A problem with the discrete equivalent of a boundary
condition, often exhibited in programs by iterative loops. From the
following problem: “If you build a fence 100 feet long with posts 10
feet apart, how many posts do you need?” (Either 9 or 11 is a better
answer than the obvious 10.) For example, suppose you have a long list
or array of items, and want to process items <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></tt> through <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></tt>; how
many items are there? The obvious answer is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">m</span></tt>, but that is off
by one; the right answer is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">m</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">1</span></tt>. A program that used the
‘obvious’ formula would have a fencepost error in it. See also
<a class="reference external" href="../Z/zeroth.html">zeroth</a> and <a class="reference external" href="../O/off-by-one-error.html">off-by-one
error</a>, and note that not all off-by-one
errors are fencepost errors. The game of Musical Chairs involves a
catastrophic off-by-one error where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N</span></tt> people try to sit in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">1</span></tt>
chairs, but it&#8217;s not a fencepost error. Fencepost errors come from
counting things rather than the spaces between them, or vice versa, or
by neglecting to consider whether one should count one or both ends of a
row.</p>
<p>2. [rare] An error induced by unexpected regularities in input values,
which can (for instance) completely thwart a theoretically efficient
binary tree or hash table implementation. (The error here involves the
difference between expected and worst case behaviors of an algorithm.)</p>

Originally, a popular or folk song with lyrics revised or completely new

be sung late at night at SF conventions. More recently (especially since
the late 1980s), filk has come to include a great deal of

moods wider than simple parody or humor. Worthy of mention here because
there is a flourishing subgenre of filks called computer filks, written

anything particularly ordinary about the referenced event. For example,
“The mail file server died this morning; we found garbage all over the
root directory. Film at 11.” would indicate that a major failure had
occurred but that the people working on it have no additional
information about it as yet; use of the phrase in this way suggests
gently that the problem is liable to be fixed more quickly if the people
doing the fixing can spend time doing the fixing rather than responding
to questions, the answers to which will appear on the normal “11:00

<p>3. vt. Either of senses 1 or 2, directed with hostility at a particular

<p>The term may have been independently invented at several different

many other places) from as far back as 1969, and from the University of
Virginia in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>It is possible that the hackish sense of ‘flame’ is much older than
that. The poet Chaucer was also what passed for a wizard hacker in his
time; he wrote a treatise on the astrolabe, the most advanced computing
device of the day. In Chaucer&#8217;s <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, Cressida laments
her inability to grasp the proof of a particular mathematical theorem;
her uncle Pandarus then observes that it&#8217;s called “the fleminge of
wrecches.” This phrase seems to have been intended in context as “that
which puts the wretches to flight” but was probably just as ambiguous in
Middle English as “the flaming of wretches” would be today. One suspects
that Chaucer would feel right at home on Usenet.</p>

flush
=========</p>
<p><strong>flush</strong>: v.</p>
<p>1. [common] To delete something, usually superfluous, or to abort an
operation. “All that nonsense has been flushed.”</p>
<p>2. [Unix/C] To force buffered I/O to disk, as with an fflush(3) call.
This is <em>not</em> an abort or deletion as in sense 1, but a demand for early

<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">

</ol>
<p>‘Flush’ was standard ITS terminology for aborting an output operation;
one spoke of the text that would have been printed, but was not, as
having been flushed. It is speculated that this term arose from a vivid
image of flushing unwanted characters by hosing down the internal output
buffer, washing the characters away before they could be printed. The
Unix/C usage, on the other hand, was propagated by the fflush(3) call in
C&#8217;s standard I/O library (though it is reported to have been in use
among BLISS programmers at <a class="reference external" href="../D/DEC.html">DEC</a> and on Honeywell
and IBM machines as far back as 1965). Unix/C hackers found the ITS
usage confusing, and vice versa.</p>

<p>For, it seems, the word ‘foo’ itself had an immediate prewar history in
comic strips and cartoons. The earliest documented uses were in the
<em>Smokey Stover</em> comic strip published from about 1930 to about 1952.
Bill Holman, the author of the strip, filled it with odd jokes and
personal contrivances, including other nonsense phrases such as “Notary
Sojac” and “1506 nix nix”. The word “foo” frequently appeared on license
plates of cars, in nonsense sayings in the background of some frames
(such as “He who foos last foos best” or “Many smoke but foo men chew”),
and Holman had Smokey say “Where there&#8217;s foo, there&#8217;s fire”.</p>
<p>According to the <a class="reference external" href="http://members.aol.com/EOCostello/">Warner Brothers Cartoon
Companion</a> Holman claimed to have
found the word “foo” on the bottom of a Chinese figurine. This is
plausible; Chinese statuettes often have apotropaic inscriptions, and
this one was almost certainly the Mandarin Chinese word <em>fu</em> (sometimes
transliterated <em>foo</em>), which can mean “happiness” or “prosperity” when
spoken with the rising tone (the lion-dog guardians flanking the steps
of many Chinese restaurants are properly called “fu dogs”). English
speakers&#8217; reception of Holman&#8217;s ‘foo’ nonsense word was undoubtedly
influenced by Yiddish ‘feh’ and English ‘fooey’ and ‘fool’.</p>
<p>Holman&#8217;s strip featured a firetruck called the Foomobile that rode on
two wheels. The comic strip was tremendously popular in the late 1930s,
and legend has it that a manufacturer in Indiana even produced an
operable version of Holman&#8217;s Foomobile. According to the Encyclopedia of
American Comics, ‘Foo’ fever swept the U.S., finding its way into
popular songs and generating over 500 ‘Foo Clubs.’ The fad left ‘foo’
references embedded in popular culture (including a couple of
appearances in Warner Brothers cartoons of 1938-39; notably in Robert
Clampett&#8217;s “Daffy Doc” of 1938, in which a very early version of Daffy
Duck holds up a sign saying “SILENCE IS FOO!”) When the fad faded, the
origin of “foo” was forgotten.</p>
<p>One place “foo” is known to have remained live is in the U.S. military
during the WWII years. In 1944-45, the term ‘foo fighters’ was in use by
radar operators for the kind of mysterious or spurious trace that would
later be called a UFO (the older term resurfaced in popular American
usage in 1995 via the name of one of the better grunge-rock bands).
Because informants connected the term directly to the Smokey Stover
strip, the folk etymology that connects it to French “feu” (fire) can be
gently dismissed.</p>
<p>The U.S. and British militaries frequently swapped slang terms during
the war (see <a class="reference external" href="../K/kluge.html">kluge</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="../K/kludge.html">kludge</a> for another important example) Period
sources reported that ‘FOO’ became a semi-legendary subject of WWII
British-army graffiti more or less equivalent to the American Kilroy.
Where British troops went, the graffito “FOO was here” or something
similar showed up. Several slang dictionaries aver that FOO probably
came from Forward Observation Officer, but this (like the
contemporaneous “FUBAR”) was probably a
<a class="reference external" href="../B/backronym.html">backronym</a> . Forty years later, Paul
Dickson&#8217;s excellent book “Words” (Dell, 1982, ISBN 0-440-52260-7) traced
“Foo” to an unspecified British naval magazine in 1946, quoting as
follows: “Mr. Foo is a mysterious Second World War product, gifted with
bitter omniscience and sarcasm.”</p>
<p>Earlier versions of this entry suggested the possibility that hacker
usage actually sprang from <em>FOO, Lampoons and Parody</em>, the title of a
comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint project of Charles
and Robert Crumb. Though Robert Crumb (then in his mid-teens) later
became one of the most important and influential artists in underground
comics, this venture was hardly a success; indeed, the brothers later
burned most of the existing copies in disgust. The title FOO was
featured in large letters on the front cover. However, very few copies
of this comic actually circulated, and students of Crumb&#8217;s <em>oeuvre</em> have
established that this title was a reference to the earlier Smokey Stover
comics. The Crumbs may also have been influenced by a short-lived
Canadian parody magazine named ‘Foo’ published in 1951-52.</p>
<p>An old-time member reports that in the 1959 <em>Dictionary of the TMRC
Language</em>, compiled at <a class="reference external" href="../T/TMRC.html">TMRC</a>, there was an entry
that went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>FOO: The first syllable of the sacred chant phrase “FOO MANE PADME
HUM.” Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning.</div></blockquote>
<p>(For more about the legendary foo counters, see
<a class="reference external" href="../T/TMRC.html">TMRC</a>.) This definition used Bill Holman&#8217;s
nonsense word, then only two decades old and demonstrably still live in
popular culture and slang, to a <a class="reference external" href="../H/ha-ha-only-serious.html">ha ha only
serious</a> analogy with esoteric Tibetan
Buddhism. Today&#8217;s hackers would find it difficult to resist elaborating
a joke like that, and it is not likely 1959&#8217;s were any less susceptible.
Almost the entire staff of what later became the MIT AI Lab was involved
with TMRC, and the word spread from there.</p>

was the ARPANET standard. ARPA funding for both the Super Foonly and the

DEC and contributed greatly to the design of the PDP-10 model KL10.</p>

<p>3. Any of the machines built by Poole&#8217;s company. The first was the F-1
(a.k.a. Super Foonly), which was the computational engine used to create
the graphics in the movie <em>TRON</em>. The F-1 was the fastest PDP-10 ever
built, but only one was ever made. The effort drained Foonly of its
financial resources, and the company turned towards building smaller,
slower, and much less expensive machines. Unfortunately, these ran not
the popular <a class="reference external" href="../T/TOPS-20.html">TOPS-20</a> but a TENEX variant called

were actually wire-wrapped engineering prototypes requiring individual

significant reliability problems. Poole&#8217;s legendary temper and
unwillingness to suffer fools gladly did not help matters. By the time
DEC&#8217;s “Jupiter Project” followon to the PDP-10 was cancelled in 1983,

<p><strong>forked</strong>: adj.,vi.</p>
<p>1. [common after 1997, esp. in the Linux community] An open-source
software project is said to have forked or be forked when the project
group fissions into two or more parts pursuing separate lines of
development (or, less commonly, when a third party unconnected to the
project group begins its own line of development). Forking is considered
a <a class="reference external" href="../B/Bad-Thing.html">Bad Thing</a> — not merely because it implies
a lot of wasted effort in the future, but because forks tend to be
accompanied by a great deal of strife and acrimony between the successor
groups over issues of legitimacy, succession, and design direction.
There is serious social pressure against forking. As a result, major
forks (such as the Gnu-Emacs/XEmacs split, the fissionings of the 386BSD
group into three daughter projects, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS split)
are rare enough that they are remembered individually in hacker
folklore.</p>

<p><strong>fork</strong></p>
<p>In the open-source community, a fork is what occurs when two (or more)
versions of a software package&#8217;s source code are being developed in
parallel which once shared a common code base, and these multiple
versions of the source code have irreconcilable differences between
them. This should not be confused with a development branch, which may
later be folded back into the original source code base. Nor should it
be confused with what happens when a new distribution of Linux or some
other distribution is created, because that largely assembles pieces
than can and will be used in other distributions without conflict.</p>
<p>Forking is uncommon; in fact, it is so uncommon that individual
instances loom large in hacker folklore. Notable in this class were the
Emacs/XEmacs fork, the GCC/EGCS fork (later healed by a merger) and the
forks among the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD operating systems.</p>

realizes that it was not recognized as such, but even ‘non-random’

<p><strong>free software</strong>: n.</p>
<p>As defined by Richard M. Stallman and used by the Free Software
movement, this means software that gives users enough freedom to be used
by the free software community. Specifically, users must be free to
modify the software for their private use, and free to redistribute it
either with or without modifications, either commercially or
noncommercially, either gratis or charging a distribution fee. Free
software has existed since the dawn of computing; Free Software as a
movement began in 1984 with the GNU Project.</p>
<p>RMS observes that the English word “free” can refer either to liberty
(where it means the same as the Spanish or French “libre”) or to price
(where it means the same as the Spanish “gratis” or French “gratuit”).
RMS and other people associated with the FSF like to explain the word
“free” in “free software” by saying “Free as in speech, not as in beer.”</p>
<p>See also <a class="reference external" href="../O/open-source.html">open source</a>. Hard-core proponents
of the term “free software” sometimes reject this newer term, claiming
that the style of argument associated with it ignores or downplays the
moral imperative at the heart of free software.</p>

boards, <a class="reference external" href="../U/Usenet.html">Usenet</a>, or other electronic media. As

enforced after his mysterious disappearance and presumed death in 1984.

implication that the item in question will ‘unfreeze’ at some future

locks out modifications intended to introduce new features but still

example is the fuzz typically allowed in floating-point calculations:
two numbers being compared for equality must be allowed to differ by a

or purple money (in implicit opposition to real or green money). In New
Zealand and Germany the odd usage paper money has been recorded; in
Germany, the particularly amusing synonym transfer ruble commemorates
the funny money used for trade between COMECON countries back when the
Soviet Bloc still existed. When your funny money ran out, your account
froze and you needed to go to a professor to get more. Fortunately, the
plunging cost of timesharing cycles has made this less common. The
amounts allocated were almost invariably too small, even for the
non-hackers who wanted to slide by with minimum work. In extreme cases,
the practice led to small-scale black markets in bootlegged computer
accounts.</p>
<p>2. By extension, phantom money or quantity tickets of any kind used as a
resource-allocation hack within a system. Antonym: real money.</p>
