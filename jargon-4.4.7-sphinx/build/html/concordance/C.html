<p><strong>camelCase</strong></p>
<p>A variable in a programming language is sait to be camelCased when all
words but the first are capitalized. This practice contrasts with the C
tradition of either running syllables together or marking syllable
breaks with underscores; thus, where a C programmer would write
thisverylongname or this_very_long_name, the camelCased version would
be thisVeryLongName. This practice is common in certain language
communities (formerly Pascal; today Java and Visual Basic) and tends to
be associated with object-oriented programming.</p>

that practice is primarily associated with marketing, camelCasing is not
aimed at impressing anybody, and hackers consider it respectable.</p>

<p><strong>candygrammar</strong>: n.</p>
<p>A programming-language grammar that is mostly <a class="reference external" href="../S/syntactic-sugar.html">syntactic

‘candygram’. <a class="reference external" href="COBOL.html">COBOL</a>, Apple&#8217;s Hypertalk language, and a
lot of the so-called ‘4GL’ database languages share this property. The
usual intent of such designs is that they be as English-like as
possible, on the theory that they will then be easier for unskilled
people to program. This intention comes to grief on the reality that
syntax isn&#8217;t what makes programming hard; it&#8217;s the mental effort and
organization required to specify an algorithm precisely that costs. Thus
the invariable result is that ‘candygrammar’ languages are just as
difficult to program in as terser ones, and far more painful for the
experienced hacker.</p>
<p>[The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live
should not be overlooked. This was a <em>Jaws</em> parody. Someone lurking
outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus ways to get the
occupant to open up, while ominous music plays in the background. The
last attempt is a half-hearted “Candygram!” When the door is opened, a
shark bursts in and chomps the poor occupant. [There is a similar gag in
“Blazing Saddles” —ESR] There is a moral here for those attracted to
candygrammars. Note that, in many circles, pretty much the same ones who
remember Monty Python sketches, all it takes is the word “Candygram!”,
suitably timed, to get people rolling on the floor. — GLS]</p>

<div class="section" id="canonical">
<h2>canonical<a class="headerlink" href="#canonical" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>canonical</strong>: adj.</p>
<p>[very common; historically, ‘according to religious law’] The usual or
standard state or manner of something. This word has a somewhat more
technical meaning in mathematics. Two formulas such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">9</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">x</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">+</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="pre">9</span></tt> are said to be equivalent because they mean the same thing,
but the second one is in canonical form because it is written in the
usual way, with the highest power of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></tt> first. Usually there are
fixed rules you can use to decide whether something is in canonical
form. The jargon meaning, a relaxation of the technical meaning,
acquired its present loading in computer-science culture largely through
its prominence in Alonzo Church&#8217;s work in computation theory and
mathematical logic (see <a class="reference external" href="../K/Knights-of-the-Lambda-Calculus.html">Knights of the Lambda
Calculus</a>). Compare
<a class="reference external" href="../V/vanilla.html">vanilla</a>.</p>
<p>Non-technical academics do not use the adjective ‘canonical’ in any of
the senses defined above with any regularity; they do however use the
nouns canon and canonicity (not **canonicalness or **canonicality).
The canon of a given author is the complete body of authentic works by
that author (this usage is familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans as well as
to literary scholars). ‘<em>The</em> canon’ is the body of works in a given
field (e.g., works of literature, or of art, or of music) deemed
worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to investigate.</p>
<p>The word ‘canon’ has an interesting history. It derives ultimately from
the Greek <em>κανον</em> (akin to the English ‘cane’) referring to a reed.
Reeds were used for measurement, and in Latin and later Greek the word
‘canon’ meant a rule or a standard. The establishment of a canon of
scriptures within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a rule
for the religion. The above non-techspeak academic usages stem from this
instance of a defined and accepted body of work. Alongside this usage
was the promulgation of ‘canons’ (‘rules’) for the government of the
Catholic Church. The techspeak usages (“according to religious law”)
derive from this use of the Latin ‘canon’.</p>
<p>Hackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic
contrast with its historical meaning. A true story: One Bob Sjoberg, new
at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance at the incessant use of
jargon. Over his loud objections, GLS and RMS made a point of using as
much of it as possible in his presence, and eventually it began to sink
in. Finally, in one conversation, he used the word canonical in
jargon-like fashion without thinking. Steele: “Aha! We&#8217;ve finally got
you talking jargon too!” Stallman: “What did he say?” Steele: “Bob just
used ‘canonical’ in the canonical way.”</p>
<p>Of course, canonicality depends on context, but it is implicitly defined
as the way <em>hackers</em> normally expect things to be. Thus, a hacker may
claim with a straight face that ‘according to religious law’ is <em>not</em>
the canonical meaning of canonical.</p>

<h2>can&#8217;t happen<a class="headerlink" href="#can-t-happen" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>can&#8217;t happen</strong></p>
<p>The traditional program comment for code executed under a condition that
should never be true, for example a file size computed as negative.
Often, such a condition being true indicates data corruption or a faulty
algorithm; it is almost always handled by emitting a fatal error message
and terminating or crashing, since there is little else that can be
done. Some case variant of “can&#8217;t happen” is also often the text emitted
if the ‘impossible’ error actually happens! Although “can&#8217;t happen”
events are genuinely infrequent in production code, programmers wise
enough to check for them habitually are often surprised at how
frequently they are triggered during development and how many headaches
checking for them turns out to head off. See also <a class="reference external" href="../F/firewall-code.html">firewall

<p><strong>cargo cult programming</strong>: n.</p>
<p>A style of (incompetent) programming dominated by ritual inclusion of
code or program structures that serve no real purpose. A cargo cult
programmer will usually explain the extra code as a way of working
around some bug encountered in the past, but usually neither the bug nor

<p>The term ‘cargo cult’ is a reference to aboriginal religions that grew
up in the South Pacific after World War II. The practices of these cults
center on building elaborate mockups of airplanes and military style
landing strips in the hope of bringing the return of the god-like
airplanes that brought such marvelous cargo during the war. Hackish
usage probably derives from Richard Feynman&#8217;s characterization of
certain practices as “cargo cult science” in his book <em>Surely You&#8217;re

<p><strong>CDA</strong>: /C·D·A/</p>
<p>The “Communications Decency Act”, passed as section 502 of a major
telecommunications reform bill on February 8th, 1996 (“Black Thursday”).
The CDA made it a federal crime in the USA to send a communication which
is “obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to
annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person.” It also threatened
with imprisonment anyone who “knowingly” makes accessible to minors any
message that “describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or
organs”.</p>
<p>While the CDA was sold as a measure to protect minors from the putative
evils of pornography, the repressive political aims of the bill were
laid bare by the Hyde amendment, which intended to outlaw discussion of
abortion on the Internet.</p>
<p>To say that this direct attack on First Amendment free-speech rights was
not well received on the Internet would be putting it mildly. A
firestorm of protest followed, including a February 29th 1996 mass
demonstration by thousands of netters who turned their <a class="reference external" href="../H/home-page.html">home

civil-rights groups and computing/telecommunications companies mounted a
constitutional challenge. The CDA was demolished by a strongly-worded

been separated from the printed portion. Also called

<p>2. The confetti-like paper bits punched out of cards or paper tape; this
has also been called chaff, computer confetti, and keypunch droppings.
It&#8217;s reported that this was very old Army slang (associated with
teletypewriters before the computer era), and has been occasionally
sighted in directions for punched-card vote tabulators long after it
passed out of live use among computer programmers in the late 1970s.
This sense of ‘chad’ returned to the mainstream during the finale of the
hotly disputed U.S. presidential election in 2000 via stories about the
Florida vote recounts. Note however that in the revived mainstream usage
chad is not a mass noun and ‘a chad’ is a single piece of the stuff.</p>
<p>There is an urban legend that chad (sense 2) derives from the Chadless
keypunch (named for its inventor), which cut little u-shaped tabs in the
card to make a hole when the tab folded back, rather than punching out a
circle/rectangle; it was clear that if the Chadless keypunch didn&#8217;t make
them, then the stuff that other keypunches made had to be ‘chad’.
However, serious attempts to track down “Chadless” as a personal name or
U.S. trademark have failed, casting doubt on this etymology — and the
U.S. Patent Classification System uses “chadless” (small c) as an
adjective, suggesting that “chadless” derives from “chad” and not the
other way around. There is another legend that the word was originally
acronymic, standing for “Card Hole Aggregate Debris”, but this has all
the earmarks of a <a class="reference external" href="../B/backronym.html">backronym</a>. It has also
been noted that the word “chad” is Scots dialect for gravel, but nobody
has proposed any plausible reason that card chaff should be thought of
as gravel. None of these etymologies is really plausible.</p>

term was used by FORTH hackers during the late 1970s/early 1980s; it is
said to have been archaic then, and may now be obsolete. It was coined
in revolt against the promiscuous use of ‘word’ for anything between 16

that made the overloading intolerable. For similar reasons, /gaw´bl/
(spelled ‘gawble’ or possibly ‘gawbul’) was in use as a term for 32 or
48 bits (presumably a full machine word, but our sources are unclear on
this). These terms are more easily understood if one thinks of them as

disk, will start making a clicking noise and refuse to eject the disk. A
common solution for retrieving the disk is to insert the bent end of a
paper clip into a small hole adjacent to the slot. “Clicked” disks are
generally unusable after being retrieved from the drive.</p>
<p>The clicking noise is caused by the drive&#8217;s read/write head bumping
against its movement stops when it fails to find track 0 on the disk,
causing the head to become misaligned. This can happen when the drive
has been subjected to a physical shock, or when the disk is exposed to
an electromagnetic field, such as that of the CRT. Another common cause
is when a package of disks is armed with an anti-theft strip at a store.
When the clerk scans the product to disarm the strip, it can demagnetize
the disks, wiping out track 0.</p>
<p>There is evidence that the click of death is a communicable disease; a
“clicked” disk can cause the read/write head of a &#8220;clean&#8221; drive to
become misaligned. Iomega at first denied the existence of the click of
death, but eventually offered to replace free of charge any drives
affected by the condition.</p>

<p><strong>coefficient of X</strong>: n.</p>
<p>Hackish speech makes heavy use of pseudo-mathematical metaphors. Four
particularly important ones involve the terms coefficient, factor, index
of X, and quotient. They are often loosely applied to things you cannot
really be quantitative about, but there are subtle distinctions among
them that convey information about the way the speaker mentally models
whatever he or she is describing. Foo factor and foo quotient tend to
describe something for which the issue is one of presence or absence.
The canonical example is <a class="reference external" href="../F/fudge-factor.html">fudge factor</a>.
It&#8217;s not important how much you&#8217;re fudging; the term simply acknowledges
that some fudging is needed. You might talk of liking a movie for its
silliness factor. Quotient tends to imply that the property is a ratio
of two opposing factors: “I would have won except for my luck quotient.”
This could also be “I would have won except for the luck factor”, but
using <em>quotient</em> emphasizes that it was bad luck overpowering good luck
(or someone else&#8217;s good luck overpowering your own). Foo index and
coefficient of foo both tend to imply that foo is, if not strictly
measurable, at least something that can be larger or smaller. Thus, you
might refer to a paper or person as having a high bogosity index,
whereas you would be less likely to speak of a high bogosity factor. Foo
index suggests that foo is a condensation of many quantities, as in the
mundane cost-of-living index; coefficient of foo suggests that foo is a
fundamental quantity, as in a coefficient of friction. The choice
between these terms is often one of personal preference; e.g., some
people might feel that bogosity is a fundamental attribute and thus say
coefficient of bogosity, whereas others might feel it is a combination
of factors and thus say bogosity index.</p>

<h2>COME FROM<a class="headerlink" href="#come-from" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>COME FROM</strong>: n.</p>
<p>A semi-mythical language construct dual to the ‘go to’; <strong>COME FROM</strong>
&lt;label&gt; would cause the referenced label to act as a sort of trapdoor,
so that if the program ever reached it control would quietly and
<a class="reference external" href="../A/automagically.html">automagically</a> be transferred to the
statement following the <strong>COME FROM</strong>. <strong>COME FROM</strong> was first proposed
in R. Lawrence Clark&#8217;s <em>A Linguistic Contribution to GOTO-less
programming</em>, which appeared in a 1973
<a class="reference external" href="../D/Datamation.html">Datamation</a> issue (and was reprinted in the
April 1984 issue of <em>Communications of the ACM</em>). This parodied the
then-raging ‘structured programming’ <a class="reference external" href="../H/holy-wars.html">holy
wars</a> (see <a class="reference external" href="considered-harmful.html">considered
harmful</a>). Mythically, some variants are
the assigned COME FROM and the computed COME FROM (parodying some nasty
control constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs). Of course,
multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be implemented by having more
than one <strong>COME FROM</strong> statement coming from the same label.</p>
<p>In some ways the FORTRAN <strong>DO</strong> looks like a <strong>COME FROM</strong> statement.
After the terminating statement number/<strong>CONTINUE</strong> is reached,
control continues at the statement following the DO. Some generous
FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements (other than <strong>CONTINUE</strong>) for
the statement, leading to examples like:</p>
<p>in which the trapdoor is just after the statement labeled 10. (This is
particularly surprising because the label doesn&#8217;t appear to have
anything to do with the flow of control at all!) While sufficiently
astonishing to the unsuspecting reader, this form of <strong>COME FROM</strong>
statement isn&#8217;t completely general. After all, control will eventually
pass to the following statement. The implementation of the general form
was left to Univac FORTRAN, ca. 1975 (though a roughly similar feature
existed on the IBM 7040 ten years earlier). The statement <strong>AT 100</strong>
would perform a <strong>COME FROM 100</strong>. It was intended strictly as a
debugging aid, with dire consequences promised to anyone so deranged as
to use it in production code. More horrible things had already been
perpetrated in production languages, however; doubters need only
contemplate the <strong>ALTER</strong> verb in <a class="reference external" href="COBOL.html">COBOL</a>. <strong>COME

megabytes-of-mass-storage. “That machine can&#8217;t run GNU Emacs, it doesn&#8217;t

<p>2. A mythical subatomic particle that bears the unit quantity of
computation or information, in much the same way that an electron bears
one unit of electric charge (see also <a class="reference external" href="../B/bogon.html">bogon</a>). An
elaborate pseudo-scientific theory of computrons has been developed
based on the physical fact that the molecules in a solid object move
more rapidly as it is heated. It is argued that an object melts because
the molecules have lost their information about where they are supposed
to be (that is, they have emitted computrons). This explains why
computers get so hot and require air conditioning; they use up
computrons. Conversely, it should be possible to cool down an object by
placing it in the path of a computron beam. It is believed that this may
also explain why machines that work at the factory fail in the computer
room: the computrons there have been all used up by the other hardware.
(The popularity of this theory probably owes something to the <em>Warlock</em>
stories by Larry Niven, the best known being <em>What Good is a Glass
Dagger?</em>, in which magic is fueled by an exhaustible natural resource

<p>[very common] Edsger W. Dijkstra&#8217;s note in the March 1968

the first salvo in the structured programming wars (text at

acrimony sufficiently harmful that it will (by policy) no longer print

(Years afterwards, a contrary view was uttered in a CACM letter called,
inevitably, <em>‘Goto considered harmful’ considered harmful&#8217;</em>&#8216;. In the
ensuing decades, a large number of both serious papers and parodies have
borne titles of the form <em>X considered Y</em>. The structured-programming

<p>Factual note: Alpha particles cause bit rot, cosmic rays do not (except
occasionally in spaceborne computers). Intel could not explain random
bit drops in their early chips, and one hypothesis was cosmic rays. So
they created the World&#8217;s Largest Lead Safe, using 25 tons of the stuff,
and used two identical boards for testing. One was placed in the safe,
one outside. The hypothesis was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit
drops, they should see a statistically significant difference between
the error rates on the two boards. They did not observe such a
difference. Further investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit
drops were due to alpha particle emissions from thorium (and to a much
lesser degree uranium) in the encapsulation material. Since it is
impossible to eliminate these radioactives (they are uniformly
distributed through the earth&#8217;s crust, with the statistically
insignificant exception of uranium lodes) it became obvious that one has
to design memories to withstand these hits.</p>

<p><strong>cracker</strong>: n.</p>
<p>One who breaks security on a system. Coined ca. 1985 by hackers in
defense against journalistic misuse of <a class="reference external" href="../H/hacker.html">hacker</a>
(q.v., sense 8). An earlier attempt to establish worm in this sense
around 1981&#8211;82 on Usenet was largely a failure.</p>
<p>Use of both these neologisms reflects a strong revulsion against the
theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings. The neologism
“cracker” in this sense may have been influenced not so much by the term
“safe-cracker” as by the non-jargon term “cracker”, which in Middle
English meant an obnoxious person (e.g., “What cracker is this same that
deafs our ears / With this abundance of superfluous breath?” —
Shakespeare&#8217;s King John, Act II, Scene I) and in modern colloquial
American English survives as a barely gentler synonym for “white trash”.</p>
<p>While it is expected that any real hacker will have done some playful
cracking and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone past <a class="reference external" href="../L/larval-stage.html">larval
stage</a> is expected to have outgrown the
desire to do so except for immediate, benign, practical reasons (for
example, if it&#8217;s necessary to get around some security in order to get
some work done).</p>
<p>Thus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom than
the <a class="reference external" href="../M/mundane.html">mundane</a> reader misled by sensationalistic
journalism might expect. Crackers tend to gather in small, tight-knit,
very secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge, open
poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to
describe <em>themselves</em> as hackers, most true hackers consider them a
separate and lower form of life. An easy way for outsiders to spot the
difference is that crackers use grandiose screen names that conceal
their identities. Hackers never do this; they only rarely use <em>noms de
guerre</em> at all, and when they do it is for display rather than
concealment.</p>
<p>Ethical considerations aside, hackers figure that anyone who can&#8217;t

drives (the term originally described what happens when the air gap of a

read/write heads dropping onto the surface of the disks and scraping off
the oxide may also be referred to as a head crash, whereas the term
system crash usually, though not always, implies that the operating
system or other software was at fault.</p>
<p>2. v. To fail suddenly. “Has the system just crashed?” “Something
crashed the OS!” See <a class="reference external" href="../D/down.html">down</a>. Also used transitively

<p><strong>cut a tape</strong>: vi.</p>
<p>To write a software or document distribution on magnetic tape for
shipment. Has nothing to do with physically cutting the medium! Early
versions of this lexicon claimed that one never analogously speaks of
‘cutting a disk’, but this has since been reported as live usage.
Related slang usages are mainstream business&#8217;s ‘cut a check’, the
recording industry&#8217;s ‘cut a record’, and the military&#8217;s ‘cut an order’.</p>
<p>All of these usages reflect physical processes in obsolete recording and
duplication technologies. The first stage in manufacturing an old-style
vinyl record involved cutting grooves in a stamping die with a precision
lathe. More mundanely, the dominant technology for mass duplication of
paper documents in pre-photocopying days involved “cutting a stencil”,
punching away portions of the wax overlay on a silk screen. More
directly, paper tape with holes punched in it was an important early
storage medium. See also <a class="reference external" href="../B/burn-a-CD.html">burn a CD</a>.</p>

(Pretty Good Privacy) digital signatures and certificates of

should hide it, but all too often users are forced to wade through it.</p>

<p><strong>cyberpunk</strong>: /si:´ber·puhnk/, n.,adj.</p>
<p>[orig. by SF writer Bruce Bethke and/or editor Gardner Dozois] A
subgenre of SF launched in 1982 by William Gibson&#8217;s epoch-making novel
<em>Neuromancer</em> (though its roots go back through Vernor Vinge&#8217;s <em>True
Names</em> (see the <a class="reference external" href="../pt03.html#bibliography">Bibliography</a> in Appendix
C) to John Brunner&#8217;s 1975 novel <em>The Shockwave Rider</em>). Gibson&#8217;s
near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture
enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the
future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly naïve and
tremendously stimulating. Gibson&#8217;s work was widely imitated, in
particular by the short-lived but innovative <em>Max Headroom</em> TV series.

flatline</a>.</p>
<p>Since 1990 or so, popular culture has included a movement or fashion
trend that calls itself ‘cyberpunk’, associated especially with the
rave/techno subculture. Hackers have mixed feelings about this. On the
one hand, self-described cyberpunks too often seem to be shallow
trendoids in black leather who have substituted enthusiastic blathering
about technology for actually learning and <em>doing</em> it. Attitude is no
substitute for competence. On the other hand, at least cyberpunks are
excited about the right things and properly respectful of hacking talent
in those who have it. The general consensus is to tolerate them politely
in hopes that they&#8217;ll attract people who grow into being true hackers.</p>

<p><strong>cyberspace</strong>: /si:´br·spays`/, n.</p>
<p>1. Notional ‘information-space’ loaded with visual cues and navigable
with brain-computer interfaces called cyberspace decks; a characteristic
prop of <a class="reference external" href="cyberpunk.html">cyberpunk</a> SF. Serious efforts to
construct <a class="reference external" href="../V/virtual-reality.html">virtual reality</a> interfaces
modeled explicitly on Gibsonian cyberspace are under way, using more
conventional devices such as glove sensors and binocular TV headsets.
Few hackers are prepared to deny outright the possibility of a
cyberspace someday evolving out of the network (see <a class="reference external" href="../T/the-network.html">the
network</a>).</p>
<p>2. The Internet or <a class="reference external" href="../M/Matrix.html">Matrix</a> (sense #2) as a
whole, considered as a crude cyberspace (sense 1). Although this usage
became widely popular in the mainstream press during 1994 when the
Internet exploded into public awareness, it is strongly deprecated among
hackers because the Internet does not meet the high, SF-inspired
standards they have for true cyberspace technology. Thus, this use of
the term usually tags a <a class="reference external" href="../W/wannabee.html">wannabee</a> or outsider.
Oppose <a class="reference external" href="../M/meatspace.html">meatspace</a>.</p>
<p>3. Occasionally, the metaphoric location of the mind of a person in
<a class="reference external" href="../H/hack-mode.html">hack mode</a>. Some hackers report experiencing
strong synesthetic imagery when in hack mode; interestingly, independent
reports from multiple sources suggest that there are common features to
the experience. In particular, the dominant colors of this subjective
cyberspace are often gray and silver, and the imagery often involves
constellations of marching dots, elaborate shifting patterns of lines
and angles, or moire patterns.</p>

<span id="index-16"></span><h2>cycle<a class="headerlink" href="#cycle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>cycle</strong></p>
<p>1. n. The basic unit of computation. What every hacker wants more of
(noted hacker Bill Gosper described himself as a “cycle junkie”). One
can describe an instruction as taking so many clock cycles. Often the
computer can access its memory once on every clock cycle, and so one
speaks also of memory cycles. These are technical meanings of
<a class="reference external" href="cycle.html">cycle</a>. The jargon meaning comes from the observation
that there are only so many cycles per second, and when you are sharing
a computer the cycles get divided up among the users. The more cycles
the computer spends working on your program rather than someone else&#8217;s,
the faster your program will run. That&#8217;s why every hacker wants more
cycles: so he can spend less time waiting for the computer to respond.</p>
<p>2. By extension, a notional unit of <em>human</em> thought power, emphasizing
that lots of things compete for the typical hacker&#8217;s think time. “I
refused to get involved with the Rubik&#8217;s Cube back when it was big. Knew
I&#8217;d burn too many cycles on it if I let myself.”</p>
<p>3. vt. Syn. <a class="reference external" href="../B/bounce.html">bounce</a> (sense 4), from the phrase
‘cycle power’. “Cycle the machine again, that serial port&#8217;s still hung.”</p>
