<h2>Pascal<a class="headerlink" href="#pascal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Pascal</strong>: n.</p>
<p>An Algol-descended language designed by Niklaus Wirth on the CDC 6600
around 1967&#8211;68 as an instructional tool for elementary programming.
This language, designed primarily to keep students from shooting
themselves in the foot and thus extremely restrictive from a
general-purpose-programming point of view, was later promoted as a
general-purpose tool and, in fact, became the ancestor of a large family
of languages including Modula-2 and Ada (see also
<a class="reference external" href="../B/bondage-and-discipline-language.html">bondage-and-discipline
language</a>). The hackish
point of view on Pascal was probably best summed up by a devastating
(and, in its deadpan way, screamingly funny) 1981 paper by Brian
Kernighan (of <a class="reference external" href="../K/K-ampersand-R.html">K&amp;R</a> fame) entitled <em>Why
Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language</em>, which was turned down
by the technical journals but circulated widely via photocopies. It was
eventually published in <em>Comparing and Assessing Programming Languages</em>,
edited by Alan Feuer and Narain Gehani (Prentice-Hall, 1984). Part of
his discussion is worth repeating here, because its criticisms are still
apposite to Pascal itself after many years of improvement and could also
stand as an indictment of many other bondage-and-discipline languages.
(The entire essay is available at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html">http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html</a>.)
At the end of a summary of the case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="9">
<li>There is no escape</li>
</ol>
<p>This last point is perhaps the most important. The language is
inadequate but circumscribed, because there is no way to escape its
limitations. There are no casts to disable the type-checking when
necessary. There is no way to replace the defective run-time
environment with a sensible one, unless one controls the compiler
that defines the “standard procedures”. The language is closed.</p>
<p>People who use Pascal for serious programming fall into a fatal
trap. Because the language is impotent, it must be extended. But
each group extends Pascal in its own direction, to make it look like
whatever language they really want. Extensions for separate
compilation, FORTRAN-like COMMON, string data types, internal static
variables, initialization, octal numbers, bit operators, etc., all
add to the utility of the language for one group but destroy its
portability to others.</p>
<p>I feel that it is a mistake to use Pascal for anything much beyond
its original target. In its pure form, Pascal is a toy language,
suitable for teaching but not for real programming.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Pascal has since been entirely displaced (mainly by
<a class="reference external" href="../C/C.html">C</a>) from the niches it had acquired in serious
applications and systems programming, and from its role as a teaching
language by Java.</p>

<p>4. A set of modifications to binaries to be applied by a patching
program. IBM operating systems often receive updates to the operating
system in the form of absolute hexadecimal patches. If you have modified
your OS, you have to disassemble these back to the source. The patches
might later be corrected by other patches on top of them (patches were
said to “grow scar tissue”). The result was often a convoluted <a class="reference external" href="patch-space.html">patch

<p>5. [Unix] the patch(1) program, written by Larry Wall, which
automatically applies a patch (sense 3) to a set of source code.</p>
<p>There is a classic story of a <a class="reference external" href="../T/tiger-team.html">tiger team</a>
penetrating a secure military computer that illustrates the danger
inherent in binary patches (or, indeed, any patches that you can&#8217;t — or
don&#8217;t — inspect and examine before installing). They couldn&#8217;t find any
<a class="reference external" href="../T/trap-door.html">trap door</a>s or any way to penetrate
security of IBM&#8217;s OS, so they made a site visit to an IBM office
(remember, these were official military types who were purportedly on
official business), swiped some IBM stationery, and created a fake
patch. The patch was actually the trapdoor they needed. The patch was
distributed at about the right time for an IBM patch, had official
stationery and all accompanying documentation, and was dutifully
installed. The installation manager very shortly thereafter learned
something about proper procedures.</p>

<p><strong>phase</strong></p>
<p>1. n. The offset of one&#8217;s waking-sleeping schedule with respect to the
standard 24-hour cycle; a useful concept among people who often work at
night and/or according to no fixed schedule. It is not uncommon to
change one&#8217;s phase by as much as 6 hours per day on a regular basis.
“What&#8217;s your phase?” “I&#8217;ve been getting in about 8PM lately, but I&#8217;m
going to <a class="reference external" href="../W/wrap-around.html">wrap around</a> to the day schedule
by Friday.” A person who is roughly 12 hours out of phase is sometimes
said to be in night mode. (The term day mode is also (but less
frequently) used, meaning you&#8217;re working 9 to 5 (or, more likely, 10 to
6).) The act of altering one&#8217;s cycle is called changing phase; phase
shifting has also been recently reported from Caltech.</p>
<p>2. change phase the hard way: To stay awake for a very long time in
order to get into a different phase.</p>
<p>3. change phase the easy way: To stay asleep, etc. However, some claim
that either staying awake longer or sleeping longer is easy, and that it
is <em>shortening</em> your day or night that is really hard (see <a class="reference external" href="../W/wrap-around.html">wrap
around</a>). The ‘jet lag’ that afflicts
travelers who cross many time-zone boundaries may be attributed to two
distinct causes: the strain of travel per se, and the strain of changing
phase. Hackers who suddenly find that they must change phase drastically
in a short period of time, particularly the hard way, experience
something very like jet lag without traveling.</p>

<h2>phase of the moon<a class="headerlink" href="#phase-of-the-moon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>phase of the moon</strong>: n.</p>
<p>Used humorously as a random parameter on which something is said to
depend. Sometimes implies unreliability of whatever is dependent, or
that reliability seems to be dependent on conditions nobody has been
able to determine. “This feature depends on having the channel open in
mumble mode, having the foo switch set, and on the phase of the moon.”
See also <a class="reference external" href="../H/heisenbug.html">heisenbug</a>.</p>
<p>True story: Once upon a time there was a program bug that really did
depend on the phase of the moon. There was a little subroutine that had
traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an
approximation to the moon&#8217;s true phase. GLS incorporated this routine
into a LISP program that, when it wrote out a file, would print a
timestamp line almost 80 characters long. Very occasionally the first
line of the message would be too long and would overflow onto the next
line, and when the file was later read back in the program would
<a class="reference external" href="../B/barf.html">barf</a>. The length of the first line depended on
both the precise date and time and the length of the phase specification
when the timestamp was printed, and so the bug literally depended on the
phase of the moon!</p>
<p>The first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983) included an
example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug, but the
typesetter ‘corrected’ it. This has since been described as the
phase-of-the-moon-bug bug.</p>
<p>However, beware of assumptions. A few years ago, engineers of CERN
(European Center for Nuclear Research) were baffled by some errors in
experiments conducted with the LEP particle accelerator. As the
formidable amount of data generated by such devices is heavily processed
by computers before being seen by humans, many people suggested the
software was somehow sensitive to the phase of the moon. A few desperate
engineers discovered the truth; the error turned out to be the result of
a tiny change in the geometry of the 27km circumference ring, physically
caused by the deformation of the Earth by the passage of the Moon! This
story has entered physics folklore as a Newtonian vengeance on particle
physics and as an example of the relevance of the simplest and oldest
physical laws to the most modern science.</p>

there was a gentleman&#8217;s agreement that phreaking as an intellectual game

taboo. There was significant crossover between the hacker community and
the hard-core phone phreaks who ran semi-underground networks of their
own through such media as the legendary <em>TAP Newsletter</em>. This ethos
began to break down in the mid-1980s as wider dissemination of the
techniques put them in the hands of less responsible phreaks. Around the
same time, changes in the phone network made old-style technical
ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it, so phreaking came to
depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phone-card
numbers. The crimes and punishments of gangs like the ‘414 group’ turned
that game very ugly. A few old-time hackers still phreak casually just
to keep their hand in, but most these days have hardly even heard of
‘blue boxes’ or any of the other paraphernalia of the great phreaks of

through. So he used the sound-recording feature on the NeXT, then wrote
a script that repeatedly invoked ping(8), listened for an echo, and
played back the recording on each returned packet. Result? A program
that caused the machine to repeat, over and over, “Ping ... ping ...
ping ...” as long as the network was up. He turned the volume to
maximum, ferreted through the building with one ear cocked, and found a
faulty tee connector in no time.</p>

<p>In the late 1980s, researchers at Bell Labs (especially Rob Pike of
Kernighan &amp; Pike fame) got bored with the limitations of UNIX and
decided to reimplement the entire system. The result was called Plan 9
in “the Bell Labs tradition of selecting names that make marketeers
wince.” The developers also wished to pay homage to the famous film,
“Plan 9 From Outer Space”, considered by some to be the worst movie ever
made. The source is available for download under open-source terms. The

Standard Kilogram at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures

circumference of the Earth. From 1960 to 1984 it was defined to be
1650763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red line of krypton-86 propagating
in a vacuum. It is now defined as the length of the path traveled by
light in a vacuum in the time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. The
kilogram is now the only unit of measure officially defined in terms of
a unique artifact. But this will have to change; in 2003 it was revealed

<h2>Postel&#8217;s Prescription<a class="headerlink" href="#postel-s-prescription" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Postel&#8217;s Prescription</strong></p>
<p>[proposed] Several of the key Internet <a class="reference external" href="../R/RFC.html">RFC</a>s,
especially 1122 and 791 contain a piece of advice due to Jon Postel,
which is most often stated as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.”</div></blockquote>
<p>That is, a well-engineered implementation of any of the Internet
protocols should be willing to deal with marginal and imperfectly-formed
inputs, but should not assume that the program on the other end (that
is, the program dealing with the well-engineered implementation&#8217;s
output) will be anything other than rigid and inflexible, and perhaps
even incomplete or downright buggy.</p>
<p>This property is valuable because a network of programs adhering to it
will be much more robust in the presence of any uncertainties in the
protocol specifications, or any individual implementor&#8217;s failure to
understand those specifications perfectly. Though the policy does tend
to accommodate broken implementations it is held to more important to
get the communication flowing than to immediately (but terminally)
diagnose the broken implementations at the expense of the people trying
to use them.</p>
<p>The principle is a well-known one in the design of programs that handle
Internet wire protocols, especially network relays and servers, and it
is regularly applied by extension in any situation where two or more
separately-implemented pieces of software are supposed to interoperate
even though the various implementors have never talked to each other and
have absolutely nothing whatsoever in common other than having all read
the same protocol specification. The principle travels under several
different names, including “the Internet credo”, “the IETF maxim”, “the
Internet Engineering Principle”, and “the liberal/conservative rule”;
the [proposed] term “Postel&#8217; Prescription” is a tribute to its inventor,
the first RFC editor and (until his untimely death) probably the single
most respected individual in the Internet engineering community.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="../S/Stone-Age.html">Stone Age</a>, now obsolescent. The punched card
actually predated computers considerably, originating in 1801 as a
control device for mechanical looms. The version patented by Hollerith
and used with mechanical tabulating machines in the 1890 U.S. Census was
a piece of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm. There is a widespread myth
that it was designed to fit in the currency trays used for that era&#8217;s
larger dollar bills, but recent investigations have falsified this.</p>
<p>IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married the
punched card to computers, encoding binary information as patterns of
small rectangular holes; one character per column, 80 columns per card.
Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and hole shapes were tried at
various times.</p>
<p>The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the IBM
punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards distributed
with many varieties of computers even today. See

<h2>punt<a class="headerlink" href="#punt" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>punt</strong>: v.</p>
<p>[from the punch line of an old joke referring to American football:
“Drop back 15 yards and punt!”]</p>
<p>1. To give up, typically without any intention of retrying. “Let&#8217;s punt
the movie tonight.” “I was going to hack all night to get this feature
in, but I decided to punt” may mean that you&#8217;ve decided not to stay up
all night, and may also mean you&#8217;re not ever even going to put in the
feature.</p>
<p>2. More specifically, to give up on figuring out what the <a class="reference external" href="../R/Right-Thing.html">Right
Thing</a> is and resort to an inefficient hack.</p>
<p>3. A design decision to defer solving a problem, typically because one
cannot define what is desirable sufficiently well to frame an
algorithmic solution. “No way to know what the right form to dump the
graph in is — we&#8217;ll punt that for now.”</p>
<p>4. To hand a tricky implementation problem off to some other section of
the design. “It&#8217;s too hard to get the compiler to do that; let&#8217;s punt to
the runtime system.”</p>
<p>5. To knock someone off an Internet or chat connection; a punter thus,
is a person or program that does this.</p>

<p><strong>purple wire</strong>: n.</p>
<p>[IBM] Wire installed by Field Engineers to work around problems
discovered during testing or debugging. These are called ‘purple wires’
even when (as is frequently the case) their actual physical color is
yellow.... Compare <a class="reference external" href="../B/blue-wire.html">blue wire</a>, <a class="reference external" href="../Y/yellow-wire.html">yellow

<h2>push<a class="headerlink" href="#push" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>push</strong></p>
<p>[from the operation that puts the current information on a stack, and
the fact that procedure return addresses are saved on a stack] (Also
PUSH /push/ or PUSHJ /push´J/, the latter based on the PDP-10 procedure
call instruction.)</p>
<p>1. To put something onto a <a class="reference external" href="../S/stack.html">stack</a>. If one says
that something has been pushed onto one&#8217;s stack, it means that the
Damoclean list of things hanging over ones&#8217;s head has grown longer and
heavier yet. This may also imply that one will deal with it <em>before</em>
other pending items; otherwise one might say that the thing was ‘added
to my queue’.</p>

later. Antonym of <a class="reference external" href="pop.html">pop</a>; see also

<p><strong>Python</strong>: /pi:´thon/</p>
<p>In the words of its author, “the other scripting language” (other than
<a class="reference external" href="Perl.html">Perl</a>, that is). Python&#8217;s design is notably clean,
elegant, and well thought through; it tends to attract the sort of
programmers who find Perl grubby and exiguous. Some people revolt at its
use of whitespace to define logical structure by indentation, objecting
that this harks back to the horrible old fixed-field languages of the
1960s. Python&#8217;s relationship with Perl is rather like the
<a class="reference external" href="../B/BSD.html">BSD</a> community&#8217;s relationship to
<a class="reference external" href="../L/Linux.html">Linux</a> — it&#8217;s the smaller party in a (usually
friendly) rivalry, but the average quality of its developers is
generally conceded to be rather higher than in the larger community it
competes with. There&#8217;s a Python resource page at
