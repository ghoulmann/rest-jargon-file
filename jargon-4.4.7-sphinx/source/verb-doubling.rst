Verb Doubling
==============

A standard construction in English is to double a verb and use it as an
exclamation, such as “Bang, bang!” or “Quack, quack!”. Most of these are
names for noises. Hackers also double verbs as a concise, sometimes
sarcastic comment on what the implied subject does. Also, a doubled verb
is often used to terminate a conversation, in the process remarking on
the current state of affairs or what the speaker intends to do next.
Typical examples involve `win <W/win.html>`__,
`lose <L/lose.html>`__, `hack <H/hack.html>`__,
`flame <F/flame.html>`__, `barf <B/barf.html>`__,
`chomp <C/chomp.html>`__::

    “The disk heads just crashed.” “Lose, lose.”

    “Mostly he talked about his latest crock. Flame, flame.”

    “Boy, what a bagbiter! Chomp, chomp!

Some verb-doubled constructions have special meanings not immediately
obvious from the verb. These have their own listings in the lexicon.

The `Usenet <U/Usenet.html>`__ culture has one *tripling* convention
unrelated to this; the names of ‘joke’ topic groups often have a tripled
last element. The first and paradigmatic example was
"alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork" (a *Muppet Show* reference); other
infamous examples have included:

* "alt.french.captain.borg.borg.borg"

* "alt.wesley.crusher.die.die.die"

* "comp.unix.internals.system.calls.brk.brk.brk"

* "sci.physics.edward.teller.boom.boom.boom"

* "alt.sadistic.dentists.drill.drill.drill"

These two traditions fuse in the newsgroup
"alt.adjective.noun.verb.verb.verb", devoted to humor based on
deliberately confounding parts of speech. Several observers have noted
that the contents of this group is excellently representative of the
peculiarities of hacker humor.
