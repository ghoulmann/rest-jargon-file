Crackers, Phreaks, and Lamers
----------------------------------------

From the early 1980s onward, a flourishing culture of local,
MS-DOS-based bulletin boards developed separately from Internet
hackerdom. The BBS culture has, as its seamy underside, a stratum of
‘pirate boards’ inhabited by `crackers <C/cracker.html>`__, phone
phreaks, and `warez d00dz <W/warez-d00dz.html>`__. These people
(mostly teenagers running IBM-PC clones from their bedrooms) have
developed their own characteristic jargon, heavily influenced by
skateboard lingo and underground-rock slang. While BBS technology
essentially died out after the `Great Internet
Explosion*<G/Great-Internet-Explosion.html>`__, the cracker culture
moved to IRC and other Internet-based network channels and maintained a
semi-underground existence.

Though crackers often call themselves ‘hackers’, they aren't (they
typically have neither significant programming ability, nor Internet
expertise, nor experience with UNIX or other true multi-user systems).
Their vocabulary has little overlap with hackerdom's, and hackers regard
them with varying degrees of contempt. But ten years on the brightest
crackers tend to become hackers, and sometimes to recall their origins
by using cracker slang in a marked and heavily ironic way.

This lexicon covers much of cracker slang (which is often called
“leet-speak”) so the reader will be able to understand both what leaks
out of the cracker underground and the occasional ironic use by hackers.

Here is a brief guide to cracker and `warez
d00dz <W/warez-d00dz.html>`__ usage:

-  Misspell frequently. The substitutions phone → fone and freak →
   phreak are obligatory.

-  Always substitute ‘z’s for ‘s’s. (i.e. “codes” → “codez”). The
   substitution of ‘z’ for ‘s’ has evolved so that a ‘z’ is now
   systematically put at the end of words to denote an illegal or
   cracking connection. Examples : Appz, passwordz, passez, utilz, MP3z,
   distroz, pornz, sitez, gamez, crackz, serialz, downloadz, FTPz, etc.

-  Type random emphasis characters after a post line (i.e. “Hey
   Dudes!#!$#$!#!$”).

-  Use the emphatic ‘k’ prefix (“k-kool”, “k-rad”, “k-awesome”)
   frequently.

-  Abbreviate compulsively (“I got lotsa warez w/ docs”).

-  TYPE ALL IN CAPS LOCK, SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE YELLING ALL THE TIME.

The following letter substitutions are common:

| 
|      a → 4
|      e → 3
|      f → ph
|      i → 1 or \|
|      l → \| or 1
|      m → \|\\/\|
|      n → \|\\\|
|      o → 0
|      s → 5
|      t → 7 or +

Thus, “elite” comes out “31337” and “all your base are belong to us”
becomes “4ll y0ur b4s3 4r3 b3l0ng t0 us”, Other less common
substitutions include:

| 
|      b → 8
|      c → ( or k or \|< or /<
|      d → <\|
|      g → 6 or 9
|      h → \|-\|
|      k → \|< or /<
|      p → \|2
|      u → \|\_\|
|      v → / or \\/
|      w → // or \\/\\/
|      x → ><
|      y → '/

The word “cool” is spelled “kewl” and normally used ironically; when
crackers really want to praise something they use the prefix “uber”
(from German) which comes out “ub3r” or even “\|\_\|83r”

These traits are similar to those of `*B1FF* <B/B1FF.html>`__, who
originated as a parody of naive `*BBS* <B/BBS.html>`__ users; also of
his latter-day equivalent `Jeff K. <J/Jeff-K-.html>`__. Occasionally,
this sort of distortion may be used as heavy sarcasm or ironically by a
real hacker, as in:

                                                                         
    `> I got X Windows running under Linux!`
                                                                          
    `d00d!  u R an 31337 hax0r`
                                                                          

The words “hax0r” for “hacker” and “sux0r” for “sucks” are the most
common references; more generally, to mark a term as cracker-speak one
may add “0r” or “xor”. Examples:

| 
|      “The nightly build is sux0r today.”
|      “Gotta go reboot those b0x0rz.”
|      “Man, I really ought to fix0r my .fetchmailrc.”
| 
    “Yeah, well he's a 'leet VMS operat0r now, so he's too good for us.”

The only practice resembling this in native hacker usage is the
substitution of a dollar sign of ‘s’ in names of products or service
felt to be excessively expensive, e.g. Compu$erve, Micro$oft.
