Revision History
-----------------------------

The original Jargon File was a collection of hacker jargon from
technical cultures including the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI lab (SAIL),
and others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities including Bolt,
Beranek and Newman (BBN), Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU), and
Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

The Jargon File (hereafter referred to as ‘jargon-1’ or ‘the File’) was
begun by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975. From this time until the
plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in 1991, the File was named
AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC] there. Some terms in it date back considerably earlier
(`frob <F/frob.html>`__ and some senses of `moby <M/moby.html>`__,
for instance, go back to the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT and are
believed to date at least back to the early 1960s). The revisions of
jargon-1 were all unnumbered and may be collectively considered ‘Version
1’.

In 1976, Mark Crispin, having seen an announcement about the File on the
SAIL computer, FTPed a copy of the File to MIT. He noticed that it was
hardly restricted to ‘AI words’ and so stored the file on his directory
as AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON.

The file was quickly renamed JARGON > (the ‘>’ caused versioning under
ITS) as a flurry of enhancements were made by Mark Crispin and Guy L.
Steele Jr. Unfortunately, amidst all this activity, nobody thought of
correcting the term ‘jargon’ to ‘slang’ until the compendium had already
become widely known as the Jargon File.

Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter
and Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File (which was
subsequently kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic
resynchronizations).

The File expanded by fits and starts until about 1983; Richard Stallman
was prominent among the contributors, adding many MIT and ITS-related
coinages.

In Spring 1981, a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of the
File published in Stewart Brand's *CoEvolution Quarterly* (issue 29,
pages 26—35) with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy Steele (including
a couple of the Crunchly cartoons). This appears to have been the File's
first paper publication.

A late version of jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass
market, was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as *The
Hacker's Dictionary* (Harper & Row CN 1082, ISBN 0-06-091082-8). The
other jargon-1 editors (Raphael Finkel, Don Woods, and Mark Crispin)
contributed to this revision, as did Richard M. Stallman and Geoff
Goodfellow. This book (now out of print) is hereafter referred to as
‘Steele-1983’ and those six as the Steele-1983 coauthors.

Shortly after the publication of Steele-1983, the File effectively
stopped growing and changing. Originally, this was due to a desire to
freeze the file temporarily to facilitate the production of Steele-1983,
but external conditions caused the ‘temporary’ freeze to become
permanent.

The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding cuts
and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor-supported
hardware and software instead of homebrew whenever possible. At MIT,
most AI work had turned to dedicated LISP Machines. At the same time,
the commercialization of AI technology lured some of the AI Lab's best
and brightest away to startups along the Route 128 strip in
Massachusetts and out West in Silicon Valley. The startups built LISP
machines for MIT; the central MIT-AI computer became a
`TWENEX <T/TWENEX.html>`__ system rather than a host for the AI
hackers' beloved `ITS <I/ITS.html>`__.

The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980, although
the SAIL computer continued as a Computer Science Department resource
until 1991. Stanford became a major `TWENEX <T/TWENEX.html>`__ site,
at one point operating more than a dozen TOPS-20 systems; but by the
mid-1980s most of the interesting software work was being done on the
emerging BSD Unix standard.

In April 1983, the PDP-10-centered cultures that had nourished the File
were dealt a death-blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter project at
Digital Equipment Corporation. The File's compilers, already dispersed,
moved on to other things. Steele-1983 was partly a monument to what its
authors thought was a dying tradition; no one involved realized at the
time just how wide its influence was to be.

By the mid-1980s the File's content was dated, but the legend that had
grown up around it never quite died out. The book, and softcopies
obtained off the ARPANET, circulated even in cultures far removed from
MIT and Stanford; the content exerted a strong and continuing influence
on hacker language and humor. Even as the advent of the microcomputer
and other trends fueled a tremendous expansion of hackerdom, the File
(and related materials such as the `Some AI Koans <koans.html>`__ in
Appendix A) came to be seen as a sort of sacred epic, a hacker-culture
Matter of Britain chronicling the heroic exploits of the Knights of the
Lab. The pace of change in hackerdom at large accelerated tremendously —
but the Jargon File, having passed from living document to icon,
remained essentially untouched for seven years.

This revision contains nearly the entire text of a late version of
jargon-1 (a few obsolete PDP-10-related entries were dropped after
careful consultation with the editors of Steele-1983). It merges in
about 80% of the Steele-1983 text, omitting some framing material and a
very few entries introduced in Steele-1983 that are now also obsolete.

This new version casts a wider net than the old Jargon File; its aim is
to cover not just AI or PDP-10 hacker culture but all the technical
computing cultures wherein the true hacker-nature is manifested. More
than half of the entries now derive from `Usenet <U/Usenet.html>`__
and represent jargon now current in the C and Unix communities, but
special efforts have been made to collect jargon from other cultures
including IBM PC programmers, Amiga fans, Mac enthusiasts, and even the
IBM mainframe world.

Eric S. Raymond "<esr@thyrsus.com>" maintains the new File with
assistance from Guy L. Steele Jr. "<gls@think.com>"; these are the
persons primarily reflected in the File's editorial ‘we’, though we take
pleasure in acknowledging the special contribution of the other
coauthors of Steele-1983. Please email all additions, corrections, and
correspondence relating to the Jargon File to Eric.

The 2.9.6 version became the main text of *The New Hacker's Dictionary*,
by Eric Raymond (ed.), MIT Press 1991, ISBN 0-262-68069-6.

The 3.0.0 version was published in August 1993 as the second edition of
*The New Hacker's Dictionary*, again from MIT Press (ISBN
0-262-18154-1).

The 4.0.0 version was published in September 1996 as the third edition
of *The New Hacker's Dictionary* from MIT Press (ISBN 0-262-68092-0).

The maintainers are committed to updating the on-line version of the
Jargon File through and beyond paper publication, and will continue to
make it available to archives and public-access sites as a trust of the
hacker community.

Raymond, approved by Guy Steele. Many items of UNIX, C, USENET, and microcomputer-based jargon were added at that time.

A very few entries from jargon-1 which were basically straight techspeak were deleted; this enabled the rest of Appendix B (created in 2.1.1) to be merged back into main text and the appendix replaced with the Portrait of J. Random Hacker. More USENET submissions were added.

Version numbering: Version numbers should be read as
major.minor.revision. Major version 1 is reserved for the ‘old’ (ITS)
Jargon File, jargon-1. Major version 2 encompasses revisions by ESR
(Eric S. Raymond) with assistance from GLS (Guy L. Steele, Jr.) leading
up to and including the second paper edition. From now on, major version
number N.00 will probably correspond to the Nth paper edition. Usually
later versions will either completely supersede or incorporate earlier
versions, so there is generally no point in keeping old versions around.

Our thanks to the coauthors of Steele-1983 for oversight and assistance,
and to the hundreds of Usenetters (too many to name here) who
contributed entries and encouragement. More thanks go to several of the
old-timers on the Usenet group "alt.folklore.computers", who
contributed much useful commentary and many corrections and valuable
historical perspective: Joseph M. Newcomer "<jn11+@andrew.cmu.edu>",
Bernie Cosell "<cosell@bbn.com>", Earl Boebert "<boebert@SCTC.com>",
and Joe Morris "<jcmorris@mwunix.mitre.org>".

We were fortunate enough to have the aid of some accomplished linguists.
David Stampe "<stampe@hawaii.edu>" and Charles Hoequist
"<hoequist@bnr.ca>" contributed valuable criticism; Joe Keane
"<jgk@osc.osc.com>" helped us improve the pronunciation guides.

A few bits of this text quote previous works. We are indebted to Brian
A. LaMacchia "<bal@zurich.ai.mit.edu>" for obtaining permission for us
to use material from the *TMRC Dictionary*; also, Don Libes
"<libes@cme.nist.gov>" contributed some appropriate material from his
excellent book *Life With UNIX*. We thank Per Lindberg
"<per@front.se>", author of the remarkable Swedish-language 'zine
*Hackerbladet*, for bringing *FOO!* comics to our attention and
smuggling one of the IBM hacker underground's own baby jargon files out
to us. Thanks also to Maarten Litmaath for generously allowing the
inclusion of the ASCII pronunciation guide he formerly maintained. And
our gratitude to Marc Weiser of XEROX PARC
"<Marc_Weiser.PARC@xerox.com>" for securing us permission to quote
from PARC's own jargon lexicon and shipping us a copy.

It is a particular pleasure to acknowledge the major contributions of
Mark Brader and Steve Summit "<scs@eskimo.com>" to the File and
Dictionary; they have read and reread many drafts, checked facts, caught
typos, submitted an amazing number of thoughtful comments, and done
yeoman service in catching typos and minor usage bobbles. Their rare
combination of enthusiasm, persistence, wide-ranging technical
knowledge, and precisionism in matters of language has been of
invaluable help. Indeed, the sustained volume and quality of Mr.
Brader's input over a decade and several different editions has only
allowed him to escape co-editor credit by the slimmest of margins.

Finally, George V. Reilly "<georgere@microsoft.com>" helped with TeX
arcana and painstakingly proofread some 2.7 and 2.8 versions, and Eric
Tiedemann "<est@thyrsus.com>" contributed sage advice throughout on
rhetoric, amphigory, and philosophunculism.
