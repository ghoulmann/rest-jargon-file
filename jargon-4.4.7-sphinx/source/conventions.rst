-------------------------------------
Other Lexicon Conventions
-------------------------------------

Entries are sorted in case-blind ASCII collation order (rather than the
letter-by-letter order ignoring interword spacing common in mainstream
dictionaries), except that all entries beginning with nonalphabetic
characters are sorted before A, except that leading dash is ignored. The
case-blindness is a feature, not a bug.

Prefix \*\* is used as linguists do; to mark examples of incorrect
usage.

We follow the ‘logical’ quoting convention described in the Writing
Style section above. In addition, we reserve double quotes for actual
excerpts of text or (sometimes invented) speech. Scare quotes (which
mark a word being used in a nonstandard way), and philosopher's quotes
(which turn an utterance into the string of letters or words that name
it) are both rendered with single quotes.

References such as malloc(3) and patch(1) are to Unix facilities (some
of which, such as patch(1), are actually open source distributed over
Usenet). The Unix manuals use "foo(n)" to refer to item foo in section
("n") of the manual, where "n=1" is utilities, "n=2" is system
calls, "n=3" is C library routines, "n=6" is games, and "n=8"
(where present) is system administration utilities. Sections 4, 5, and 7
of the manuals have changed roles frequently and in any case are not
referred to in any of the entries.

Various abbreviations used frequently in the lexicon are summarized
here:

Where alternate spellings or pronunciations are given, *alt.* separates
two possibilities with nearly equal distribution, while *var.* prefixes
one that is markedly less common than the primary.

Where a term can be attributed to a particular subculture or is known to
have originated there, we have tried to so indicate. Here is a list of
abbreviations used in etymologies:

Other etymology abbreviations such as `Unix <U/Unix.html>`__ and
`PDP-10 <P/PDP-10.html>`__ refer to technical cultures surrounding
specific operating systems, processors, or other environments. The fact
that a term is labelled with any one of these abbreviations does not
necessarily mean its use is confined to that culture. In particular,
many terms labelled ‘MIT’ and ‘Stanford’ are in quite general use. We
have tried to give some indication of the distribution of speakers in
the usage notes; however, a number of factors mentioned in the
introduction conspire to make these indications less definite than might
be desirable.

A few new definitions attached to entries are marked [proposed]. These
are usually generalizations suggested by editors or Usenet respondents
in the process of commenting on previous definitions of those entries.
These are *not* represented as established jargon.
