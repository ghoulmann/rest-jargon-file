tail recursion
==============


**tail recursion**: n.

If you aren't sick of it already, see `tail
recursion <tail-recursion.html>`__.


talker system
==============


**talker system**: n.

British hackerism for software that enables real-time chat or `talk
mode <talk-mode.html>`__.


talk mode
=========

**talk mode**: n.

A feature supported by Unix and some other OSes that allows two or more
logged-in users to set up a real-time on-line conversation. It combines
the immediacy of talking with all the precision (and verbosity) that
written language entails. It is difficult to communicate inflection,
though conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section on
writing style in the Prependices for details).

Talk mode has a special set of jargon words, used to save typing, which
are not used orally. Some of these are identical to (and probably
derived from) Morse-code jargon used by ham-radio amateurs since the
1920s.

| <name>:            | When three or more terminals are linked, it is conventional for each typist to `prepend <./P.html#prepend.html>`__ his/her login name or handle and a colon (or a hyphen) to each line to indicate who is typing (some conferencing facilities do this automatically). The login name is often shortened to a unique prefix (possibly a single letter) during a very long conversation.   |

Most of these are not used at universities or in the Unix world, though
ROTF and TTFN have gained some currency there and IMHO is common;
conversely, most of the people who know these are unfamiliar with FOO?,
BCNU, HELLOP, `NIL <./N.html#NIL.html>`__, and `T <T.html>`__.

The `MUD <./M.html#MUD.html>`__ community uses a mixture of
Usenet/Internet emoticons, a few of the more natural of the old-style
talk-mode abbrevs, and some of the ‘social’ list above; specifically,
MUD respondents report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW, WTF, TTFN, and
WTH. The use of rehi is also common; in fact, mudders are fond of re-
compounds and will frequently rehug or rebonk (see
`bonk/oif <./B.html#bonk-oif.html>`__) people. The word re by itself is
taken as ‘regreet’. In general, though, MUDders express a preference for
typing things out in full rather than using abbreviations; this may be
due to the relative youth of the MUD cultures, which tend to include
many touch typists and to assume high-speed links. The following uses
specific to MUDs are reported:

+-----------+      ---+
| CU l8er   | see you later (mutant of **CU l8tr**)                                                 |
+-----------+      ---+
| FOAD      | fuck off and die (use of this is generally OTT)                                       |
+-----------+      ---+
| OTT       | over the top (excessive, uncalled for)                                                |
+-----------+      ---+
| ppl       | abbrev for “people”                                                                   |
+-----------+      ---+
| THX       | thanks (mutant of **TNX**; clearly this comes in batches of 1138 (the Lucasian K)).   |
+-----------+      ---+
| UOK?      | are you OK?                                                                           |
+-----------+      ---+

Some `B1FF <./B.html#B1FF.html>`__\ isms (notably the variant spelling
**d00d**) appear to be passing into wider use among some subgroups of
MUDders.

One final note on talk mode style: neophytes, when in talk mode, often
seem to think they must produce letter-perfect prose because they are
typing rather than speaking. This is not the best approach. It can be
very frustrating to wait while your partner pauses to think of a word,
or repeatedly makes the same spelling error and backs up to fix it. It
is usually best just to leave typographical errors behind and plunge
forward, unless severe confusion may result; in that case it is often
fastest just to type “xxx” and start over from before the mistake.

TAN
=======


**TAN**: adj.

[Usenet, particularly "rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan"] Abbrev. of
‘tangent’, as in “off on a tangent”, and synonym for
`OT <./O.html#OT.html>`__. A number of hacker-humor synonyms are used for
TAN in some newsgroups. Instances such as BEIGE, OFF-WHITE,
BROWNISH-GRAY, and LIGHT BROWN have been observed. It is generally
understood on newsgroups with this convention that any color descriptor
is a TAN synonym if (a) used as the first word(s) of the topic of a
Usenet post, (b) written in ALL CAPS, and (c) followed immediately by a
colon. Usage: “OFF-WHITE: 2000 Presidential candidates” on an SF
newsgroup.



tanked
===========


**tanked**: adj.

Same as `down <./D.html#down.html>`__, used primarily by Unix hackers. See
also `hosed <./H.html#hosed.html>`__. Popularized as a synonym for ‘drunk’
by Steve Dallas in the late lamented *Bloom County* comic strip.

TANSTAAFL
================


**TANSTAAFL**: /tan´stah·fl/

[acronym, from Robert Heinlein's classic SF novel *The Moon is a Harsh
Mistress*.] “There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch”, often invoked
when someone is balking at the prospect of using an unpleasantly
`heavyweight <./H.html#heavyweight.html>`__ technique, or at the poor
quality of some piece of software, or at the `signal-to-noise
ratio <./S.html#signal-to-noise-ratio.html>`__ of unmoderated Usenet
newsgroups. “What? Don't tell me I have to implement a database back end
to get my address book program to work!” “Well, TANSTAAFL you know.”
This phrase owes some of its popularity to the high concentration of
science-fiction fans and political libertarians in hackerdom (see
`Appendix B <../appendixb.html>`__ for discussion).

Outside hacker circles the variant TINSTAAFL (“There is No Such
Thing...”) is apparently more common, and can be traced back to 1952 in
the writings of ethicist Alvin Hansen. TANSTAAFL may well have arisen
from it by mutation.



tape monkey
==================


**tape monkey**: n.

A junior system administrator, one who might plausibly be assigned to do
physical swapping of tapes and subsequent storage. When a backup needs
to be restored, one might holler “Tape monkey!” (Compare `one-banana
problem <./O.html#one-banana-problem.html>`__) Also used to dismiss jobs
not worthy of a highly trained sysadmin's ineffable talents: “Cable up
her PC? You must be joking — I'm no tape monkey.”

tar and feather
======================



**tar and feather**: vi.

[from Unix tar(1)] To create a transportable archive from a group of
files by first sticking them together with tar(1) (the Tape ARchiver)
and then compressing the result (see
`compress <./C.html#compress.html>`__). The latter action is dubbed
feathering partly for euphony and (if only for contrived effect) by
analogy to what you do with an airplane propeller to decrease wind
resistance, or with an oar to reduce water resistance; smaller files,
after all, slip through comm links more easily. Compare the more common
`tarball <tarball.html>`__. Earlier, the phrase referred to a
punishment in which the victims had tar being poured upon them and then,
whilst the tar was still sticky, having a pillow full of feathers - or
other material — thrown at them. See
`http://www.nwta.com/Spy/spring99/tar.html <http://www.nwta.com/Spy/spring99/tar.html>`__.

tarball
============


**tarball**: n.

[very common; prob. based on the “tar baby” in the Uncle Remus folk
tales] An archive, created with the Unix tar(1) utility, containing
myriad related files. “Here, I'll just ftp you a tarball of the whole
project.” Tarballs have been the standard way to ship around source-code
distributions since the mid-1980s; in retrospect it seems odd that this
term did not enter common usage until the late 1990s.


tardegy
=============


**tardegy**: tar´d­jee, n.

[deliberate mangling of tragedy] An incident in which someone who
clearly deserves to be selected out of the gene pool on grounds of
extreme stupidity meets with a messy end. Coined on the Darwin list,
which is dedicated to chronicling such incidents; but almost all hackers
would instantly recognize the intention of the term and laugh.

taste
=================


**taste**: n.

1. The quality in a program that tends to be inversely proportional to
the number of features, hacks, and kluges programmed into it. Also
tasty, tasteful, tastefulness. “This feature comes in "N" tasty
flavors.” Although tasty and flavorful are essentially synonyms, taste
and `flavor <./F.html#flavor.html>`__ are not. Taste refers to sound
judgment on the part of the creator; a program or feature can *exhibit*
taste but cannot *have* taste. On the other hand, a feature can have
`flavor <./F.html#flavor.html>`__. Also, `flavor <./F.html#flavor.html>`__
has the additional meaning of ‘kind’ or ‘variety’ not shared by taste.
The marked sense of `flavor <./F.html#flavor.html>`__ is more popular than
taste, though both are widely used. See also `elegant <./E.html#elegant.html>`__.

2. Alt. sp. of `tayste <tayste.html>`__.


tayste
===========


**tayste**: /tayst/

n. Two bits; also as `taste <taste.html>`__. Syn.
`crumb <./C.html#crumb.html>`__, `quarter <./Q.html#quarter.html>`__. See
`nybble <./N.html#nybble.html>`__.

TCB
=============



**TCB**: /T·C·B/, n.

[IBM] 1. Trouble Came Back. An intermittent or difficult-to-reproduce
problem that has failed to respond to neglect or `shotgun
debugging <./S.html#shotgun-debugging.html>`__. Compare
`heisenbug <./H.html#heisenbug.html>`__. Not to be confused with:

2. Trusted Computing Base, an ‘official’ jargon term from the `Orange
Book <./O.html#Orange-Book.html>`__.


TCP/IP
=============


**TCP/IP**: /T´C·P I´P/, n.

1. [Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol] The
wide-area-networking protocol that makes the Internet work, and the only
one most hackers can speak the name of without laughing or retching.
Unlike such allegedly ‘standard’ competitors such as X.25, DECnet, and
the ISO 7-layer stack, TCP/IP evolved primarily by actually being
*used*, rather than being handed down from on high by a vendor or a
heavily-politicized standards committee. Consequently, it (a) works, (b)
actually promotes cheap cross-platform connectivity, and (c) annoys the
hell out of corporate and governmental empire-builders everywhere.
Hackers value all three of these properties. See
`creationism <./C.html#creationism.html>`__.

2. [Amateur Packet Radio] Formerly expanded as “The Crap Phil Is
Pushing”. The reference is to Phil Karn, KA9Q, and the context was an
ongoing technical/political war between the majority of sites still
running AX.25 and the TCP/IP relays. TCP/IP won.

TECO
===========



**TECO**: /tee´koh/, n.,v. obs.

1. [originally an acronym for ‘[paper] Tape Editor and COrrector’;
later, ‘Text Editor and COrrector’] n. A text editor developed at MIT
and modified by just about everybody. With all the dialects included,
TECO may have been the most prolific editor in use before
`EMACS <./E.html#EMACS.html>`__, to which it was directly ancestral. Noted
for its powerful programming-language-like features and its unspeakably
`hairy <./H.html#hairy.html>`__ syntax. It is literally the case that
every string of characters is a valid TECO program (though probably not
a useful one); one common game used to be mentally working out what the
TECO commands corresponding to human names did.

2. vt. Originally, to edit using the TECO editor in one of its infinite
variations (see below).

3. vt.,obs. To edit even when TECO is *not* the editor being used! This
usage is rare and now primarily historical.

As an example of TECO's obscurity, here is a TECO program that takes a
list of names such as:

| 
|  Loser, J. Random
|  Quux, The Great
|  Dick, Moby

sorts them alphabetically according to surname, and then puts the
surname last, removing the comma, to produce the following:

| 
|  Moby Dick
|  J. Random Loser
|  The Great Quux

The program is

| 
|  [1 J^P$L$$
|  J <.-Z; .,(S,$ -D .)FX1 @F^B $K :L I $ G1 L>$$

(where ^B means ‘Control-B’ (ASCII 0000010) and $ is actually an
`alt <./A.html#alt.html>`__ or escape (ASCII 0011011) character).

In fact, this very program was used to produce the second, sorted list
from the first list. The first hack at it had a
`bug <./B.html#bug.html>`__: GLS (the author) had accidentally omitted the
**@** in front of **F^B**, which as anyone can see is clearly the
`Wrong Thing <./W.html#Wrong-Thing.html>`__. It worked fine the second
time. There is no space to describe all the features of TECO, but it may
be of interest that **^P** means ‘sort’ and **J<.-Z; ... L>** is an
idiomatic series of commands for ‘do once for every line’.

In mid-1991, TECO is pretty much one with the dust of history, having
been replaced in the affections of hackerdom by
`EMACS <./E.html#EMACS.html>`__. Descendants of an early (and somewhat
lobotomized) version adopted by DEC can still be found lurking on VMS
and a couple of crufty `PDP-11 <./P.html#PDP-11.html>`__ operating
systems, however, and ports of the more advanced MIT versions remain the
focus of some antiquarian interest. See also
`retrocomputing <./R.html#retrocomputing.html>`__, `write-only
language <./W.html#write-only-language.html>`__.


tee
======================


**tee**: n.,vt.

[Purdue] A carbon copy of an electronic transmission. “Oh, you're
sending him the `bits <./B.html#bits.html>`__ to that? Slap on a tee for
me.” From the Unix command tee(1), itself named after a pipe fitting
(see `plumbing <./P.html#plumbing.html>`__). Can also mean ‘save one for
me’, as in “Tee a slice for me!” Also spelled ‘T’.

teergrube
============


**teergrube**: /teer´groob·@/, n.

[German for tar pit] A trap set to punish spammers who use an `address
harvester <./A.html#address-harvester.html>`__; a mail server deliberately
set up to be really, really slow. To activate it, scatter addresses that
look like users on the teergrube's host in places where the address
harvester will be trolling (one popular way is to embed the fake address
in a Usenet sig block next to a human-readable warning not to send mail
to it). The address harvester will dutifully collect the address. When
the spammer tries to mailbomb it, his mailer will get stuck.

teledildonics
===============


**teledildonics**: /tel\`@·dil·do'·niks/, n.

Sex in a computer simulated virtual reality, esp. computer-mediated
sexual interaction between the `VR <./V.html#VR.html>`__ presences of two
humans. This practice is not yet possible except in the rather limited
form of erotic conversation on `MUD <./M.html#MUD.html>`__\ s and the
like. The term, however, is widely recognized in the VR community as a
`ha ha only serious <./H.html#ha-ha-only-serious.html>`__ projection of
things to come. “When we can sustain a multi-sensory surround good
enough for teledildonics, *then* we'll know we're getting somewhere.”
See also `hot chat <./H.html#hot-chat.html>`__.


ten-finger interface
=================================


**ten-finger interface**: n.

The interface between two networks that cannot be directly connected for
security reasons; refers to the practice of placing two terminals side
by side and having an operator read from one and type into the other.

tense
===================




**tense**: adj.

Of programs, very clever and efficient. A tense piece of code often got
that way because it was highly tuned, but sometimes it was just based on
a great idea. A comment in a clever routine by Mike Kazar, once a
grad-student hacker at CMU: “This routine is so tense it will bring
tears to your eyes.” A tense programmer is one who produces tense code.


tentacle
=================


**tentacle**: n.

A covert `pseudo <./P.html#pseudo.html>`__, sense 1. An artificial
identity created in cyberspace for nefarious and deceptive purposes. The
implication is that a single person may have multiple tentacles. This
term was originally floated in some paranoid ravings on the cypherpunks
list (see `cypherpunk <./C.html#cypherpunk.html>`__), and adopted in a
spirit of irony by other, saner members. It has since shown up, used
seriously, in the documentation for some remailer software, and is now
(1994) widely recognized on the net. Compare
`astroturfing <./A.html#astroturfing.html>`__, `sock
puppet <./S.html#sock-puppet.html>`__.


tenured graduate student
==============================


**tenured graduate student**: n.

One who has been in graduate school for 10 years (the usual maximum is 5
or 6): a ‘ten-yeared’ student (get it?). Actually, this term may be used
of any grad student beginning in his seventh year. Students don't really
get tenure, of course, the way professors do, but a tenth-year graduate
student has probably been around the university longer than any
untenured professor.


teraflop club
====================


**teraflop club**: /te´r@·flop kluhb/, n.

[FLOP = Floating Point Operation] A mythical association of people who
consume outrageous amounts of computer time in order to produce a few
simple pictures of glass balls with intricate ray-tracing techniques.
Caltech professor James Kajiya is said to have been the founder. Compare
`Knights of the Lambda
Calculus <./K.html#Knights-of-the-Lambda-Calculus.html>`__.


tera-
===========


**tera-**: /te´r@/, pref.

[SI] See `quantifiers <./Q.html#quantifiers.html>`__.

terminak
============



**terminak**: /ter´mi·nak\`/, n.

[Caltech, ca. 1979] Any malfunctioning computer terminal. A common
failure mode of Lear-Siegler ADM 3a terminals caused the ‘L’ key to
produce the ‘K’ code instead; complaints about this tended to look like
“Terminak #3 has a bad keyboard. Pkease fix.” Compare `dread high-bit
disease <./D.html#dread-high-bit-disease.html>`__,
`frogging <./F.html#frogging.html>`__; see also
`sun-stools <./S.html#sun-stools.html>`__,
`HP-SUX <./H.html#HP-SUX.html>`__, `Slowlaris <./S.html#Slowlaris.html>`__.


terminal brain death
=======================


**terminal brain death**: n.

The extreme form of `terminal illness <terminal-illness.html>`__
(sense 1). What someone who has obviously been hacking continuously for
far too long is said to be suffering from.

terminal illness
======================


**terminal illness**: n.

1. Syn. `raster burn <./R.html#raster-burn.html>`__.

2. The ‘burn-in’ condition your CRT tends to get if you don't have a
screen saver.

terminal junkie
====================================


**terminal junkie**: n.

[UK] A `wannabee <./W.html#wannabee.html>`__ or early `larval
stage <./L.html#larval-stage.html>`__ hacker who spends most of his or her
time wandering the directory tree and writing
`noddy <./N.html#noddy.html>`__ programs just to get a fix of computer
time. Variants include terminal jockey, console junkie, and `console
jockey <./C.html#console-jockey.html>`__. The term console jockey seems to
imply more expertise than the other three (possibly because of the
exalted status of the `console <./C.html#console.html>`__ relative to an
ordinary terminal). See also `twink <twink.html>`__, `ead-only
user <./R.html#read-only-user.html>`__. Appropriately, this term was used
in the works of William S. Burroughs to describe a heroin addict with an
unlimited supply.

test
=============


**test**: n.

1. Real users bashing on a prototype long enough to get thoroughly
acquainted with it, with careful monitoring and followup of the results.

2. Some bored random user trying a couple of the simpler features with a
developer looking over his or her shoulder, ready to pounce on mistakes.

Judging by the quality of most software, the second definition is far
more prevalent. See also `demo <./D.html#demo.html>`__.

TeX
===========


**TeX**: /tekh/, n.

An extremely powerful `macro <./M.html#macro.html>`__-based text formatter
written by Donald E. `Knuth <./K.html#Knuth.html>`__, very popular in the
computer-science community (it is good enough to have displaced Unix
`troff <troff.html>`__, the other favored formatter, even at many Unix
installations). TeX fans insist on the correct (guttural) pronunciation,
and the correct spelling (all caps, squished together, with the E
depressed below the baseline; the mixed-case ‘TeX’ is considered an
acceptable kluge on ASCII-only devices). Fans like to proliferate names
from the word ‘TeX’ — such as TeXnician (TeX user), TeXhacker (TeX
programmer), TeXmaster (competent TeX programmer), TeXhax, and TeXnique.
See also `CrApTeX <./C.html#CrApTeX.html>`__.

Knuth began TeX because he had become annoyed at the declining quality
of the typesetting in volumes I--III of his monumental *Art of Computer
Programming* (see `Knuth <./K.html#Knuth.html>`__, also
`bible <./B.html#bible.html>`__). In a manifestation of the typical
hackish urge to solve the problem at hand once and for all, he began to
design his own typesetting language. He thought he would finish it on
his sabbatical in 1978; he was wrong by only about 8 years. The language
was finally frozen around 1985, but volume IV of *The Art of Computer
Programming* is not expected to appear until 2007. The impact and
influence of TeX's design has been such that nobody minds this very
much. Many grand hackish projects have started as a bit of
`toolsmith <toolsmith.html>`__\ ing on the way to something else;
Knuth's diversion was simply on a grander scale than most.

TeX has also been a noteworthy example of free, shared, but high-quality
software. Knuth offers a monetary award to anyone who found and reported
bugs dating from before the 1989 code freeze; as the years wore on and
the few remaining bugs were fixed (and new ones even harder to find),
the bribe went up. Though well-written, TeX is so large (and so full of
cutting edge technique) that it is said to have unearthed at least one
bug in every Pascal system it has been compiled with.


text
=============



**text**: n.

1. [techspeak] Executable code, esp. a pure code portion shared between
multiple instances of a program running in a multitasking OS. Compare
`English <./E.html#English.html>`__.

2. Textual material in the mainstream sense; data in ordinary
`ASCII <./A.html#ASCII.html>`__ or `EBCDIC <./E.html#EBCDIC.html>`__
representation (see `flat-ASCII <./F.html#flat-ASCII.html>`__). “Those are
text files; you can review them using the editor.”

These two contradictory senses confuse hackers, too.


thanks in advance
============================



**thanks in advance**

[Usenet] Conventional net.politeness ending a posted request for
information or assistance. Sometimes written ‘advTHANKSance’ or
‘aTdHvAaNnKcSe’ or abbreviated ‘TIA’. See `net.- <./N.html#net--.html>`__,
`netiquette <./N.html#netiquette.html>`__.


That's not a bug, that's a feature!
==========================================


**That's not a bug, that's a feature!**

The `canonical <./C.html#canonical.html>`__ first parry in a debate about
a purported bug. The complainant, if unconvinced, is likely to retort
that the bug is then at best a `misfeature <./M.html#misfeature.html>`__.
See also `feature <./F.html#feature.html>`__.

the literature
==========================


**the literature**: n.

Computer-science journals and other publications, vaguely gestured at to
answer a question that the speaker believes is
`trivial <trivial.html>`__. Thus, one might answer an annoying
question by saying “It's in the literature.” Oppose
`Knuth <./K.html#Knuth.html>`__, which has no connotation of triviality.

the network
===================



**the network**: n.

1. Historically, the union of all the major noncommercial, academic, and
hacker-oriented networks, such as Internet, the pre-1990 ARPANET,
NSFnet, BITNET, and the virtual UUCP and `Usenet <./U.html#Usenet.html>`__
‘networks’, plus the corporate in-house networks and commercial
timesharing services (such as CompuServe, GEnie and AOL) that gateway to
them. A site is generally considered on the network if it can be reached
through some combination of Internet-style (@-sign) and UUCP (bang-path)
addresses. See `Internet <./I.html#Internet.html>`__, `bang
path <./B.html#bang-path.html>`__, `network
address <./N.html#network-address.html>`__.

2. Following the mass-culture discovery of the Internet in 1994 and
subsequent proliferation of cheap TCP/IP connections, “the network” is
increasingly synonymous with the Internet itself (as it was before the
second wave of wide-area computer networking began around 1980).

3. A fictional conspiracy of libertarian hacker-subversives and
anti-authoritarian monkeywrenchers described in Robert Anton Wilson's
novel *Schrödinger's Cat*, to which many hackers have subsequently
decided they belong (this is an example of `ha ha only
serious <./H.html#ha-ha-only-serious.html>`__).

In sense 1, the network is often abbreviated to the net. “Are you on the
net?” is a frequent question when hackers first meet face to face, and
“See you on the net!” is a frequent goodbye.


theology
============


**theology**: n.

1. Ironically or humorously used to refer to `religious
issues <./R.html#religious-issues.html>`__.

2. Technical fine points of an abstruse nature, esp. those where the
resolution is of theoretical interest but is relatively
`marginal <./M.html#marginal.html>`__ with respect to actual use of a
design or system. Used esp. around software issues with a heavy AI or
language-design component, such as the smart-data vs. smart-programs
dispute in AI.


theory
==============


**theory**: n.

The consensus, idea, plan, story, or set of rules that is currently
being used to inform a behavior. This usage is a generalization and
(deliberate) abuse of the technical meaning. “What's the theory on
fixing this TECO loss?” “What's the theory on dinner tonight?”
(“Chinatown, I guess.”) “What's the current theory on letting lusers on
during the day?” “The theory behind this change is to fix the following
well-known screw....”


the X that can be Y is not the true X
=========================================



**the X that can be Y is not the true X**

Yet another instance of hackerdom's peculiar attraction to mystical
references — a common humorous way of making exclusive statements about
a class of things. The template is from the *Tao te Ching*: “The Tao
which can be spoken of is not the true Tao.” The implication is often
that the X is a mystery accessible only to the enlightened. See the
`trampoline <trampoline.html>`__ entry for an example, and compare
`has the X nature <./H.html#has-the-X-nature.html>`__.


thinko
================



**thinko**: /thing´koh/, n.

[by analogy with ‘typo’] A momentary, correctable glitch in mental
processing, especially one involving recall of information learned by
rote; a bubble in the stream of consciousness. Syn.
`braino <./B.html#braino.html>`__; see also `brain
fart <./B.html#brain-fart.html>`__. Compare `mouso <./M.html#mouso.html>`__.


This can't happen
====================


**This can't happen**

Less clipped variant of `can't happen <./C.html#can-t-happen.html>`__.



This time, for sure!
==========================


**This time, for sure!**: excl.

Ritual affirmation frequently uttered during protracted debugging
sessions involving numerous small obstacles (e.g., attempts to bring up
a UUCP connection). For the proper effect, this must be uttered in a
fruity imitation of Bullwinkle J. Moose. Also heard: “Hey, Rocky! Watch
me pull a rabbit out of my hat!” The
`canonical <./C.html#canonical.html>`__ response is, of course, “But that
trick *never* works!” See `hacker humor <./H.html#hacker-humor.html>`__.

thrash
===================



**thrash**: vi.

To move wildly or violently, without accomplishing anything useful.
Paging or swapping systems that are overloaded waste most of their time
moving data into and out of core (rather than performing useful
computation) and are therefore said to thrash. Someone who keeps
changing his mind (esp. about what to work on next) is said to be
thrashing. A person frantically trying to execute too many tasks at once
(and not spending enough time on any single task) may also be described
as thrashing. Compare `multitask <./M.html#multitask.html>`__.


thread
===============



**thread**: n.

[Usenet, GEnie, CompuServe] Common abbreviation of topic thread, a more
or less continuous chain of postings on a single topic. To follow a
thread is to read a series of Usenet postings sharing a common subject
or (more correctly) which are connected by Reference headers. The better
newsreaders can present news in thread order automatically. Not to be
confused with the techspeak sense of ‘thread’, e.g. a lightweight
process.

Interestingly, this is far from a neologism. The OED says: “That which
connects the successive points in anything, esp. a narrative, train of
thought, or the like; the sequence of events or ideas continuing
throughout the whole course of anything;” Citations are given going back
to 1642!


three-finger salute
===========================


**three-finger salute**: n.

Syn. `Vulcan nerve pinch <./V.html#Vulcan-nerve-pinch.html>`__.


throwaway account
==========================


**throwaway account**: n.

1. An inexpensive Internet account purchased on a legitimate
`ISP <./I.html#ISP.html>`__ for the sole purpose of spewing
`spam <./S.html#spam.html>`__.

2. An inexpensive Internet account obtained for the sole purpose of
doing something which requires a valid email address but being able to
ignore spam since the user will not look at the account again.


T
=========

**T**: /T/

1. [from LISP terminology for ‘true’] Yes. Used in reply to a question
(particularly one asked using `The -P
convention <../p-convention.html>`__). In LISP, the constant T means
‘true’, among other things. Some Lisp hackers use ‘T’ and ‘NIL’ instead
of ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ almost reflexively. This sometimes causes
misunderstandings. When a waiter or flight attendant asks whether a
hacker wants coffee, he may absently respond ‘T’, meaning that he wants
coffee; but of course he will be brought a cup of tea instead.
Fortunately, most hackers (particularly those who frequent Chinese
restaurants) like tea at least as well as coffee — so it is not that big
a problem.

2. See `time T <time-T.html>`__ (also `since time T equals minus
infinity <./S.html#since-time-T-equals-minus-infinity.html>`__).

3. [techspeak] In transaction-processing circles, an abbreviation for
the noun ‘transaction’.

4. [Purdue] Alternate spelling of `tee <tee.html>`__.

5. A dialect of `LISP <./L.html#LISP.html>`__ developed at Yale. (There is
an intended allusion to NIL, “New Implementation of Lisp”, another
dialect of Lisp developed for the `VAX <./V.html#VAX.html>`__)


thud
==============

**thud**: n.

1. Yet another `metasyntactic
variable <./M.html#metasyntactic-variable.html>`__ (see
`foo <./F.html#foo.html>`__). It is reported that at CMU from the
mid-1970s the canonical series of these was ‘foo’, ‘bar’, ‘thud’,
‘blat’.

2. Rare term for the hash character, ‘#’ (ASCII 0100011). See
`ASCII <./A.html#ASCII.html>`__ for other synonyms.

thumb
=========



**thumb**: n.

The slider on a window-system scrollbar. So called because moving it
allows you to browse through the contents of a text window in a way
analogous to thumbing through a book.


thundering herd problem
===========================



**thundering herd problem**

Scheduler thrashing. This can happen under Unix when you have a number
of processes that are waiting on a single event. When that event (a
connection to the web server, say) happens, every process which could
possibly handle the event is awakened. In the end, only one of those
processes will actually be able to do the work, but, in the meantime,
all the others wake up and contend for CPU time before being put back to
sleep. Thus the system thrashes briefly while a herd of processes
thunders through. If this starts to happen many times per second, the
performance impact can be significant.


thunk
========



**thunk**: /thuhnk/, n.

1. [obs.]“A piece of coding which provides an address:”, according to P.
Z. Ingerman, who invented thunks in 1961 as a way of binding actual
parameters to their formal definitions in Algol-60 procedure calls. If a
procedure is called with an expression in the place of a formal
parameter, the compiler generates a thunk which computes the expression
and leaves the address of the result in some standard location.

2. Later generalized into: an expression, frozen together with its
environment, for later evaluation if and when needed (similar to what in
techspeak is called a closure). The process of unfreezing these thunks
is called forcing.

3. A `stubroutine <./S.html#stubroutine.html>`__, in an overlay
programming environment, that loads and jumps to the correct overlay.
Compare `trampoline <trampoline.html>`__.

4. Microsoft and IBM have both defined, in their Intel-based systems, a
“16-bit environment” (with bletcherous segment registers and 64K address
limits) and a “32-bit environment” (with flat addressing and semi-real
memory management). The two environments can both be running on the same
computer and OS (thanks to what is called, in the Microsoft world, WOW
which stands for Windows On Windows). MS and IBM have both decided that
the process of getting from 16- to 32-bit and vice versa is called a
“thunk”; for Windows 95, there is even a tool THUNK.EXE called a “thunk
compiler”.

5. A person or activity scheduled in a thunklike manner. “It occurred to
me the other day that I am rather accurately modeled by a thunk — I
frequently need to be forced to completion.:” — paraphrased from a
`plan file <./P.html#plan-file.html>`__.

Historical note: There are a couple of onomatopoeic myths circulating
about the origin of this term. The most common is that it is the sound
made by data hitting the stack; another holds that the sound is that of
the data hitting an accumulator. Yet another suggests that it is the
sound of the expression being unfrozen at argument-evaluation time. In
fact, according to the inventors, it was coined after they realized (in
the wee hours after hours of discussion) that the type of an argument in
Algol-60 could be figured out in advance with a little compile-time
thought, simplifying the evaluation machinery. In other words, it had
‘already been thought of’; thus it was christened a thunk, which is “the
past tense of ‘think’ at two in the morning”.


tick
==========



**tick**: n.

1. A `jiffy <./J.html#jiffy.html>`__ (sense 1).

2. In simulations, the discrete unit of time that passes between
iterations of the simulation mechanism. In AI applications, this amount
of time is often left unspecified, since the only constraint of interest
is the ordering of events. This sort of AI simulation is often
pejoratively referred to as tick-tick-tick simulation, especially when
the issue of simultaneity of events with long, independent chains of
causes is `handwave <./H.html#handwave.html>`__\ d.

3. In the FORTH language, a single quote character.


tickle a bug
================



**tickle a bug**: vt.

To cause a normally hidden bug to manifest itself through some known
series of inputs or operations. “You can tickle the bug in the Paradise
VGA card's highlight handling by trying to set bright yellow reverse
video.”

tick-list features
=========================



**tick-list features**: n.

[Acorn Computers] Features in software or hardware that customers insist
on but never use (calculators in desktop TSRs and that sort of thing).
The American equivalent would be checklist features, but this jargon
sense of the phrase has not been reported.


tiger team
================



**tiger team**: n.

[U.S. military jargon]

1. Originally, a team (of `sneaker <./S.html#sneaker.html>`__\ s) whose
purpose is to penetrate security, and thus test security measures. These
people are paid professionals who do hacker-type tricks, e.g., leave
cardboard signs saying “bomb” in critical defense installations,
hand-lettered notes saying “Your codebooks have been stolen” (they
usually haven't been) inside safes, etc. After a successful penetration,
some high-ranking security type shows up the next morning for a
‘security review’ and finds the sign, note, etc., and all hell breaks
loose. Serious successes of tiger teams sometimes lead to early
retirement for base commanders and security officers (see the
`patch <./P.html#patch.html>`__ entry for an example).

2. Recently, and more generally, any official inspection team or special
`firefighting <./F.html#firefighting.html>`__ group called in to look at a
problem.

A subset of tiger teams are professional
`cracker <./C.html#cracker.html>`__\ s, testing the security of military
computer installations by attempting remote attacks via networks or
supposedly ‘secure’ comm channels. Some of their escapades, if
declassified, would probably rank among the greatest hacks of all times.
The term has been adopted in commercial computer-security circles in
this more specific sense.


time bomb
===================



**time bomb**: n.

A subspecies of `logic bomb <./L.html#logic-bomb.html>`__ that is
triggered by reaching some preset time, either once or periodically.
There are numerous legends about time bombs set up by programmers in
their employers' machines, to go off if the programmer is fired or laid
off and is not present to perform the appropriate suppressing action
periodically.

Interestingly, the only such incident for which we have been pointed to
documentary evidence took place in the Soviet Union in 1986! A
disgruntled programmer at the Volga Automobile Plant (where the Fiat
clones called Ladas were manufactured) planted a time bomb which, a week
after he'd left on vacation, stopped the entire main assembly line for a
day. The case attracted lots of attention in the Soviet Union because it
was the first cracking case to make it to court there. The perpetrator
got a suspended sentence of 3 years in jail and was barred from future
work as a programmer.

timesharing
======================



**timesharing**

[now primarily historical] Timesharing is the technique of scheduling a
computer's time so that they are shared across multiple tasks and
multiple users, with each user having the illusion that his or her
computation is going on continuously. John McCarthy, the inventor of
`LISP <./L.html#LISP.html>`__, first `imagined this
technique <http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/timesharing/timesharing.html>`__
in the late 1950s. The first timesharing operating systems, BBN's
"Little Hospital" and `CTSS <./C.html#CTSS.html>`__, were deplayed in
1962-63. The early hacker culture of the 1960s and 1970s grew up around
the first generation of relatively cheap timesharing computers, notably
the `DEC <./D.html#DEC.html>`__ 10, 11, and `VAX <./V.html#VAX.html>`__
lines. But these were only cheap in a relative sense; though quite a bit
less powerful than today's personal computers, they had to be shared by
dozens or even hundreds of people each. The early hacker comunities
nucleated around places where it was relatively easy to get access to a
timesharing account.

Nowadays, communications bandwidth is usually the most important
constraint on what you can do with your computer. Not so back then;
timesharing machines were often loaded to capacity, and it was not
uncommon for everyone's work to grind to a halt while the machine
scheduler thrashed, trying to figure out what to do next. Early hacker
slang was replete with terms like cycle crunch and cycle drought for
describing the consequences of too few instructions-per-second spread
among too many users. As GLS has noted, this sort of problem influenced
the tendency of many hackers to work odd schedules.

One reason this is worth noting here is to make the point that the
earliest hacker communities were physical, not distributed via networks;
they consisted of hackers who shared a machine and therefore had to deal
with many of the same problems with respect to it. A system crash could
idle dozens of eager programmers, all sitting in the same terminal room
and with little to do but talk with each other until normal operation
resumed.

Timesharing moved from being the luxury of a few large universities
runing semi-experimental operating systems to being more generally
available about 1975-76. Hackers in search of more cycles and more
control over their programming environment began to migrate off
timesharing machines and onto what are now called workstations around
1983. It took another ten years, the development of powerful 32-bit
personal micros, the `Great Internet
Explosion <./G.html#Great-Internet-Explosion.html>`__ before the migration
was complete. It is no coincidence that the last stages of this
migration coincided with the development of the first open-source
operating systems.

time sink
=============

**time sink**: n.

[poss.: by analogy with heat sink or current sink] A project that
consumes unbounded amounts of time.


times-or-divided-by
=====================

**times-or-divided-by**: quant.

[by analogy with ‘plus-or-minus’] Term occasionally used when describing
the uncertainty associated with a scheduling estimate, for either
humorous or brutally honest effect. For a software project, the
scheduling uncertainty factor is usually at least 2.


time T
===============


**time T**: /ti:m T/, n.

1. An unspecified but usually well-understood time, often used in
conjunction with a later time "T+1". “We'll meet on campus at time
"T" or at Louie's at time "T+1"\ ” means, in the context of going
out for dinner: “We can meet on campus and go to Louie's, or we can meet
at Louie's itself a bit later.” (Louie's was a Chinese restaurant in
Palo Alto that was a favorite with hackers.) Had the number 30 been used
instead of the number 1, it would have implied that the travel time from
campus to Louie's is 30 minutes; whatever time "T" is (and that hasn't
been decided on yet), you can meet half an hour later at Louie's than
you could on campus and end up eating at the same time. See also `since
time T equals minus
infinity <./S.html#since-time-T-equals-minus-infinity.html>`__.


TINC
============



**TINC**: //

[Usenet] Abbreviation: “There Is No Cabal”. See `backbone
cabal <./B.html#backbone-cabal.html>`__ and `NANA <./N.html#NANA.html>`__,
but note that this abbreviation did not enter use until long after the
dispersal of the backbone cabal.


Tinkerbell program
======================



**Tinkerbell program**: n.

[Great Britain] A monitoring program used to scan incoming network calls
and generate alerts when calls are received from particular sites, or
when logins are attempted using certain IDs. Named after ‘Project
Tinkerbell’, an experimental phone-tapping program developed by British
Telecom in the early 1980s.



TINLC
==========


**TINLC**: //

Abbreviation: “There Is No Lumber Cartel”. See `Lumber
Cartel <./L.html#Lumber-Cartel.html>`__. TINLC is a takeoff on
`TINC <TINC.html>`__.


tip of the ice-cube
=======================


**tip of the ice-cube**: n., //

[IBM] The visible part of something small and insignificant. Used as an
ironic comment in situations where ‘tip of the iceberg’ might be
appropriate if the subject were at all important.

tired iron
===============


**tired iron**: n.

[IBM] Hardware that is perfectly functional but far enough behind the
state of the art to have been superseded by new products, presumably
with sufficient improvement in bang-per-buck that the old stuff is
starting to look a bit like a `dinosaur <./D.html#dinosaur.html>`__.


tits on a keyboard
====================



**tits on a keyboard**: n.

Small bumps on certain keycaps to keep touch-typists registered. Usually
on the "5" of a numeric keypad, and on the "F" and "J" of a
`QWERTY <./Q.html#QWERTY.html>`__ keyboard; but older Macs (like pre-PC
electric typewriters) had them on the "D" and "K" keys (this changed
in 1999).

TLA
======


**TLA**: /T·L·A/, n.

[Three-Letter Acronym]

1. Self-describing abbreviation for a species with which computing
terminology is infested.

2. Any confusing acronym. Examples include MCA, FTP, SNA, CPU, MMU,
SCCS, DMU, FPU, NNTP, TLA. People who like this looser usage argue that
not all TLAs have three letters, just as not all four-letter words have
four letters. One also hears of ‘ETLA’ (Extended Three-Letter Acronym,
pronounced /ee tee el ay/) being used to describe four-letter acronyms;
the terms ‘SFLA’ (Stupid Four-Letter Acronym), ‘LFLA’ (Longer Four
Letter Acronym), and VLFLA (Very Long Five Letter Acronym) have also
been reported. See also `YABA <./Y.html#YABA.html>`__.

The self-effacing phrase “TDM TLA” (Too Damn Many...) is often used to
bemoan the plethora of TLAs in use. In 1989, a random of the
journalistic persuasion asked hacker Paul Boutin “What do you think will
be the biggest problem in computing in the 90s?” Paul's straight-faced
response: “There are only 17,000 three-letter acronyms.” (To be exact,
there are "26^3    = 17,576".) There is probably some karmic justice
in the fact that Paul Boutin subsequently became a journalist.


TMRC
==============



**TMRC**: /tmerk´/, n.

The Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT, one of the wellsprings of hacker
culture. The 1959 *Dictionary of the TMRC Language* compiled by Peter
Samson included several terms that became basics of the hackish
vocabulary (see esp. `foo <./F.html#foo.html>`__,
`mung <./M.html#mung.html>`__, and `frob <./F.html#frob.html>`__).

By 1962, TMRC's legendary layout was already a marvel of complexity and
has grown in the years since. All the features described here were still
present when the old layout was decommissioned in 1998 just before the
demolition of MIT Building 20, and will almost certainly be retained
when the old layout is rebuilt (expected in 2003). The control system
alone featured about 1200 relays. There were `scram
switch <./S.html#scram-switch.html>`__\ es located at numerous places
around the room that could be thwacked if something undesirable was
about to occur, such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction.
Another feature of the system was a digital clock on the dispatch board,
which was itself something of a wonder in those bygone days before cheap
LEDs and seven-segment displays. When someone hit a scram switch the
clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word ‘FOO’; at TMRC
the scram switches are therefore called foo switches.

Steven Levy, in his book *Hackers* (see the
`Bibliography <../pt03.html#bibliography>`__ in Appendix C), gives a
stimulating account of those early years. TMRC's Signals and Power
Committee included many of the early PDP-1 hackers and the people who
later became the core of the MIT AI Lab staff. Thirty years later that
connection is still very much alive, and this lexicon accordingly
includes a number of entries from a recent revision of the TMRC
dictionary.

TMRC has a web page at
`http://tmrc-www.mit.edu/ <http://tmrc-www.mit.edu/>`__. The TMRC
Dictionary is available there, at
`http://tmrc-www.mit.edu/dictionary.html <http://tmrc-www.mit.edu/dictionary.html>`__.


TMRCie
===========


**TMRCie**: /tmerk´ee/, n.

[MIT] A denizen of `TMRC <TMRC.html>`__.


TMTOWTDI
===============


**TMTOWTDI**: /tim·toh'·dee/, abbrev.

There's More Than One Way To Do It. This abbreviation of the official
motto of `Perl <./P.html#Perl.html>`__ is frequently used on newsgroups
and mailing lists related to that language.


toad
==========



**toad**: vt.

1. Notionally, to change a `MUD <./M.html#MUD.html>`__ player into a toad.

2. To permanently and totally exile a player from the MUD. A very
serious action, which can only be done by a MUD
`wizard <./W.html#wizard.html>`__; often involves a lot of debate among
the other characters first. See also `frog <./F.html#frog.html>`__,
`FOD <./F.html#FOD.html>`__.

to a first approximation
==============================



**to a first approximation**: adj.

1. [techspeak] When one is doing certain numerical computations, an
approximate solution may be computed by any of several heuristic
methods, then refined to a final value. By using the starting point of a
first approximation of the answer, one can write an algorithm that
converges more quickly to the correct result.

2. In jargon, a preface to any comment that indicates that the comment
is only approximately true. The remark “To a first approximation, I feel
good” might indicate that deeper questioning would reveal that not all
is perfect (e.g., a nagging cough still remains after an illness).


toaster
=====================

**toaster**: n.

1. The archetypal really stupid application for an embedded
microprocessor controller; often used in comments that imply that a
scheme is inappropriate technology (but see `elevator
controller <./E.html#elevator-controller.html>`__).
“\ `DWIM <./D.html#DWIM.html>`__ for an assembler? That'd be as silly as
running Unix on your toaster!”

2. A very, very dumb computer. “You could run this program on any dumb
toaster.” See `bitty box <./B.html#bitty-box.html>`__, `Get a real
computer! <./G.html#Get-a-real-computer-.html>`__, `toy <toy.html>`__,
`beige toaster <./B.html#beige-toaster.html>`__.

3. A Macintosh, esp. a Mac in the original unitary case. Some hold that
this is implied by sense 2.

4. A peripheral device. “I bought my box without toasters, but since
then I've added two boards and a second disk drive.”

5. A specialized computer used as an appliance. See `web
toaster <./W.html#web-toaster.html>`__, `video
toaster <./V.html#video-toaster.html>`__.


toast
=============


**toast**

1. n.Any completely inoperable system or component, esp. one that has
just crashed and burned: “Uh, oh ... I think the serial board is toast.”
(This sense went mainstream around 1993.)

2. vt. To cause a system to crash accidentally, especially in a manner
that requires manual rebooting. “Rick just toasted the `firewall
machine <./F.html#firewall-machine.html>`__ again.” Compare
`fried <./F.html#fried.html>`__.


to a zeroth approximation
==============================================



**to a zeroth approximation**

[from to a first approximation] A **really** sloppy approximation; a
wild guess. Compare `social science
number <./S.html#social-science-number.html>`__.


toeprint
================


**toeprint**: n.

A `footprint <./F.html#footprint.html>`__ of especially small size.

TOFU
===========================



**TOFU**

Text Over, Fullquote Under; see `top-post <top-post.html>`__.



toggle
=================================



**toggle**: vt.

To change a `bit <./B.html#bit.html>`__ from whatever state it is in to
the other state; to change from 1 to 0 or from 0 to

1. This comes from ‘toggle switches’, such as standard light switches,
though the word toggle actually refers to the mechanism that keeps the
switch in the position to which it is flipped rather than to the fact
that the switch has two positions. There are four things you can do to a
bit: set it (force it to be 1), clear (or zero) it, leave it alone, or
toggle it. (Mathematically, one would say that there are four distinct
boolean-valued functions of one boolean argument, but saying that is
much less fun than talking about toggling bits.)


toolchain
======================


**toolchain**

A collection of tools used to develop for a particular hardware target,
or to work with a particular data format (thus ‘the Crusoe development
toolchain’, or the ‘DocBook toolchain’). Often used in the context of
building software on one system which will be installed or run on some
other device; in that case the chain of tools usually consists of such
items as a particular version of a compiler, libraries, special headers,
etc. May also be used of text-formatting, page layout, or multimedia
tools which render from some markup to a variety of production formats.
Differs from ‘toolkit’ in that the former implies a collection of
semi-independent tools with complementary functions, while ‘toolchain’
implies that each of the parts is a serial stage in a rather tightly
bound pipeline. Seems to have become current in early 1999 and 2000; now
common.



tool
================



**tool**

1. n.A program used primarily to create, manipulate, modify, or analyze
other programs, such as a compiler or an editor or a cross-referencing
program. Oppose `app <./A.html#app.html>`__, `operating
system <./O.html#operating-system.html>`__; see also
`toolchain <toolchain.html>`__.

2. [Unix] An application program with a simple, ‘transparent’ (typically
text-stream) interface designed specifically to be used in programmed
combination with other tools (see `filter <./F.html#filter.html>`__,
`plumbing <./P.html#plumbing.html>`__).

3. [MIT: general to students there] vi. To work; to study (connotes
tedium). The TMRC Dictionary defined this as “to set one's brain to the
grindstone”. See `hack <./H.html#hack.html>`__.

4. n. [MIT] A student who studies too much and hacks too little. (MIT's
student humor magazine rejoices in the name *Tool and Die*.)


toolsmith
===================



**toolsmith**: n.

The software equivalent of a tool-and-die specialist; one who
specializes in making the `tool <tool.html>`__\ s with which other
programmers create applications. Many hackers consider this more fun
than applications per se; to understand why, see
`uninteresting <./U.html#uninteresting.html>`__. Jon Bentley, in the
“Bumper-Sticker Computer Science” chapter of his book *More Programming
Pearls*, quotes Dick Sites from `DEC <./D.html#DEC.html>`__ as saying “I'd
rather write programs to write programs than write programs”.


toor
============



**toor**: n.

The Bourne-Again Super-user. An alternate account with UID of 0, created
on Unix machines where the root user has an inconvenient choice of
shell. Compare `avatar <./A.html#avatar.html>`__.


topic drift
========================



**topic drift**: n.

Term used on GEnie, Usenet and other electronic fora to describe the
tendency of a `thread <thread.html>`__ to drift away from the original
subject of discussion (and thus, from the Subject header of the
originating message), or the results of that tendency. The header in
each post can be changed to keep current with the posts, but usually
isn't due to forgetfulness or laziness. A single post may often result
in several posts each responding to a different point in the original.
Some subthreads will actually be in response to some off-the-cuff side
comment, possibly degenerating into a `flame
war <./F.html#flame-war.html>`__, or just as often evolving into a separate
discussion. Hence, discussions aren't really so much threads as they are
trees. Except that they don't really have leaves, or multiple branching
roots; usually some lines of discussion will just sort of die off after
everyone gets tired of them. This could take anywhere from hours to
weeks, or even longer.

The term ‘topic drift’ is often used in gentle reminders that the
discussion has strayed off any useful track. “I think we started with a
question about Niven's last book, but we've ended up discussing the
sexual habits of the common marmoset. Now *that's* topic drift!”

topic group
======================



**topic group**: n.

Syn. `forum <./F.html#forum.html>`__.


top-post
===============



**top-post**: n., v.

[common] To put the newly-added portion of an email or Usenet response
before the quoted part, as opposed to the more logical sequence of
quoted portion first with original following. The problem with this
practice is neatly summed up by the following FAQ entry:

+     ----+
| .. code:: screen                                                         |
|                                                                          |
|     A: No.                                                               |
|     Q: Should I include quotations after my reply?                       |
                                                                          
+     ----+

This term is generally used pejoratively with the implication that the
offending person is a `newbie <./N.html#newbie.html>`__, a Microsoft
addict (Microsoft mail tools produce a similar format by default), or
simply a common-and-garden-variety idiot.

One major problem with top-posting is that people who do it all too
frequently quote the *entire* parent message rather than trimming it
down to those portions relevent to their reply — this makes threads
bulky and unnecessarily difficult to read and arouses the righteous ire
of experienced Internet residents (this style is called “TOFU” for “text
over, fullquote under”, or sometimes “jeopardy-style quoting”). Another
problem is that top-posters often word their replies on the assumption
that you just read the previous message, even though their perversity
has put it further down the page than you have yet read. Oppose
`bottom-post <./B.html#bottom-post.html>`__.

TOPS-10
=======================================


**TOPS-10**: /tops·ten/, n.

`DEC <./D.html#DEC.html>`__'s proprietary OS for the fabled
`PDP-10 <./P.html#PDP-10.html>`__ machines, long a favorite of hackers but
now long extinct. A fountain of hacker folklore; see Appendix A. See
also `ITS <./I.html#ITS.html>`__, `TOPS-20 <TOPS-20.html>`__,
`TWENEX <TWENEX.html>`__, `VMS <./V.html#VMS.html>`__, `operating
system <./O.html#operating-system.html>`__. TOPS-10 was sometimes called
BOTS-10 (from ‘bottoms-ten’) as a comment on the inappropriateness of
describing it as the top of anything.

TOPS-20
=====================



**TOPS-20**: /tops·twen´tee/, n.

See `TWENEX <TWENEX.html>`__.


TOS
======================================


**TOS**: vt.

[from the acronym for ‘Terms Of Service’ playing on the verb “toss”]

1. The act of terminating an Internet access account because the owner
breached the terms of service (e.g. by spamming).

2. To successfully complain to the ISP for that reason so that they then
close the account.


tourist
==============


**tourist**: n.

1. [ITS] A guest on the system, especially one who generally logs in
over a network from a remote location for `comm
mode <./C.html#comm-mode.html>`__, email, games, and other trivial
purposes. One step below `luser <./L.html#luser.html>`__. ITS hackers
often used to spell this `turist <turist.html>`__, perhaps by some
sort of tenuous analogy with `luser <./L.html#luser.html>`__ (this usage
may also have expressed the ITS culture's penchant for six-letterisms,
and/or been some sort of tribute to Alan Turing). Compare
`twink <twink.html>`__, `lurker <./L.html#lurker.html>`__, `read-only
user <./R.html#read-only-user.html>`__.

2. [IRC] An `IRC <./I.html#IRC.html>`__ user who goes from channel to
channel without saying anything; see `channel
hopping <./C.html#channel-hopping.html>`__.

touristic
==================



**touristic**: adj.

Having the quality of a `tourist <tourist.html>`__. Often used as a
pejorative, as in ‘losing touristic scum’. Often spelled ‘turistic’ or
‘turistik’, so that phrase might be more properly rendered ‘lusing
turistic scum’.


tourist information
=====================

**tourist information**: n.

Information in an on-line display that is not immediately useful, but
contributes to a viewer's gestalt of what's going on with the software
or hardware behind it. Whether a given piece of info falls in this
category depends partly on what the user is looking for at any given
time. The ‘bytes free’ information at the bottom of an MS-DOS or Windows
**dir** display is tourist information; so (most of the time) is the
TIME information in a Unix ps(1) display.

toy
=================



**toy**: n.

A computer system; always used with qualifiers.

1. nice toy: One that supports the speaker's hacking style adequately.

2. just a toy: A machine that yields insufficient
`computron <./C.html#computron.html>`__\ s for the speaker's preferred
uses. This is not condemnatory, as is `bitty
box <./B.html#bitty-box.html>`__; toys can at least be fun. It is also
strongly conditioned by one's expectations; Cray XMP users sometimes
consider the Cray-1 a toy, and certainly all RISC boxes and mainframes
are toys by their standards. See also `Get a real
computer! <./G.html#Get-a-real-computer-.html>`__.


toy language
================

**toy language**: n.

A language useful for instructional purposes or as a proof-of-concept
for some aspect of computer-science theory, but inadequate for
general-purpose programming. `Bad Thing <./B.html#Bad-Thing.html>`__\ s
can result when a toy language is promoted as a general purpose solution
for programming (see `bondage-and-discipline
language <./B.html#bondage-and-discipline-language.html>`__); the classic
example is `Pascal <./P.html#Pascal.html>`__. Several moderately
well-known formalisms for conceptual tasks such as programming Turing
machines also qualify as toy languages in a less negative sense. See
also `MFTL <./M.html#MFTL.html>`__.


toy problem
=========================


**toy problem**: n.

[AI] A deliberately oversimplified case of a challenging problem used to
investigate, prototype, or test algorithms for a real problem. Sometimes
used pejoratively. See also `gedanken <./G.html#gedanken.html>`__, `toy
program <toy-program.html>`__.


toy program
==================


**toy program**: n.

1. One that can be readily comprehended; hence, a trivial program
(compare `noddy <./N.html#noddy.html>`__).

2. One for which the effort of initial coding dominates the costs
through its life cycle. See also `noddy <./N.html#noddy.html>`__.


trampoline
==============================


**trampoline**: n.

An incredibly `hairy <./H.html#hairy.html>`__ technique, found in some
`HLL <./H.html#HLL.html>`__ and program-overlay implementations (e.g., on
the Macintosh), that involves on-the-fly generation of small executable
(and, likely as not, self-modifying) code objects to do indirection
between code sections. Under BSD and possibly in other Unixes,
trampoline code is used to transfer control from the kernel back to user
mode when a signal (which has had a handler installed) is sent to a
process. These pieces of `live data <./L.html#live-data.html>`__ are
called trampolines. Trampolines are notoriously difficult to understand
in action; in fact, it is said by those who use this term that the
trampoline that doesn't bend your brain is not the true trampoline. See
also `snap <./S.html#snap.html>`__.


trap door
==================



**trap door**: n.

(alt.: trapdoor)

1. Syn. `back door <./B.html#back-door.html>`__ — a `Bad
Thing <./B.html#Bad-Thing.html>`__.

2. [techspeak] A trap-door function is one which is easy to compute but
very difficult to compute the inverse of. Such functions are `Good
Thing <./G.html#Good-Thing.html>`__\ s with important applications in
cryptography, specifically in the construction of public-key
cryptosystems.


trap
=====================


**trap**

1. n. A program interrupt, usually an interrupt caused by some
exceptional situation in the user program. In most cases, the OS
performs some action, then returns control to the program.

2. vi. To cause a trap. “These instructions trap to the monitor.” Also
used transitively to indicate the cause of the trap. “The monitor traps
all input/output instructions.”

This term is associated with assembler programming (interrupt or
exception is more common among `HLL <./H.html#HLL.html>`__ programmers)
and appears to be fading into history among programmers as the role of
assembler continues to shrink. However, it is still important to
computer architects and systems hackers (see
`system <./S.html#system.html>`__, sense 1), who use it to distinguish
deterministically repeatable exceptions from timing-dependent ones (such
as I/O interrupts).

trash
==============================



**trash**: vt.

To destroy the contents of (said of a data structure). The most common
of the family of near-synonyms including `mung <./M.html#mung.html>`__,
`mangle <./M.html#mangle.html>`__, `scribble <./S.html#scribble.html>`__,
and `roach <./R.html#roach.html>`__.

trawl
================================



**trawl**: v.

To sift through large volumes of data (e.g., Usenet postings, FTP
archives, or the Jargon File) looking for something of interest.


tree-killer
==================================



**tree-killer**: n.

[Sun]

1. A printer.

2. A person who wastes paper. This epithet should be interpreted in a
broad sense; ‘wasting paper’ includes the production of
`spiffy <./S.html#spiffy.html>`__ but
`content-free <./C.html#content-free.html>`__ documents. Thus, most
`suit <./S.html#suit.html>`__\ s are tree-killers.

It is likely that both senses derive their flavor from the epithet
‘tree-killer’ applied by Treebeard the Ent to the Orcs in J.R.R.
Tolkien's *Lord of the Rings*. See also `elvish <./E.html#elvish.html>`__,
`elder days <./E.html#elder-days.html>`__, and especially `dead-tree
version <./D.html#dead-tree-version.html>`__.


treeware
==============================


 

**treeware**: /tree´weir/, n.

Printouts, books, and other information media made from pulped dead
trees. Compare `tree-killer <tree-killer.html>`__, see
`documentation <./D.html#documentation.html>`__.


trit
===============



**trit**: /trit/, n.

[by analogy with bit] One base-3 digit; the amount of information
conveyed by a selection among one of three equally likely outcomes (see
also `bit <./B.html#bit.html>`__). Trits arise, for example, in the
context of a `flag <./F.html#flag.html>`__ that should actually be able to
assume *three* values — such as yes, no, or unknown. Trits are sometimes
jokingly called 3-state bits. A trit may be semi-seriously referred to
as a bit and a half, although it is linearly equivalent to 1.5849625
bits (that is, log\_{2$(3)} bits).


trivial
=========================



**trivial**: adj.

1. Too simple to bother detailing.

2. Not worth the speaker's time.

3. Complex, but solvable by methods so well known that anyone not
utterly `cretinous <./C.html#cretinous.html>`__ would have thought of them
already.

4. Any problem one has already solved (some claim that hackish trivial
usually evaluates to “I've seen it before”). Hackers' notions of
triviality may be quite at variance with those of non-hackers. See
`nontrivial <./N.html#nontrivial.html>`__,
`uninteresting <./U.html#uninteresting.html>`__.

The physicist Richard Feynman, who had the hacker nature to an amazing
degree (see his essay “Los Alamos From Below” in *Surely You're Joking,
Mr. Feynman!*), defined trivial theorem as “one that has already been
proved”.


troff
====================



**troff**: /T´rof/, /trof/, n.

[Unix] The gray eminence of Unix text processing; a formatting and
phototypesetting program, written originally in
`PDP-11 <./P.html#PDP-11.html>`__ assembler and then in barely-structured
early C by the late Joseph Ossanna, modeled after the earlier ROFF which
was in turn modeled after the `Multics <./M.html#Multics.html>`__ and
`CTSS <./C.html#CTSS.html>`__ program RUNOFF by Jerome Saltzer (*that*
name came from the expression “to run off a copy”). A companion program,
nroff, formats output for terminals and line printers.

In 1979, Brian Kernighan modified troff so that it could drive
phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT. His paper
describing that work (“A Typesetter-independent troff,” AT&T CSTR #97)
explains troff's durability. After discussing the program's “obvious
deficiencies — a rebarbative input syntax, mysterious and undocumented
properties in some areas, and a voracious appetite for computer
resources” and noting the ugliness and extreme hairiness of the code and
internals, Kernighan concludes:

    None of these remarks should be taken as denigrating Ossanna's
    accomplishment with TROFF. It has proven a remarkably robust tool,
    taking unbelievable abuse from a variety of preprocessors and being
    forced into uses that were never conceived of in the original
    design, all with considerable grace under fire.

The success of `TeX <TeX.html>`__ and desktop publishing systems have
reduced **troff**'s relative importance, but this tribute perfectly
captures the strengths that secured **troff** a place in hacker
folklore; indeed, it could be taken more generally as an indication of
those qualities of good programs that, in the long run, hackers most
admire.


troglodyte
=====================


**troglodyte**: n.

[Commodore]

1. A hacker who never leaves his cubicle. The term gnoll (from Dungeons
& Dragons) is also reported.

2. A curmudgeon attached to an obsolescent computing environment. The
combination ITS troglodyte was flung around some during the Usenet and
email wringle-wrangle attending the 2.x.x revision of the Jargon File;
at least one of the people it was intended to describe adopted it with
pride.


troglodyte mode
======================================



**troglodyte mode**: n.

[Rice University] Programming with the lights turned off, sunglasses on,
and the terminal inverted (black on white) because you've been up for so
many days straight that your eyes hurt (see `raster
burn <./R.html#raster-burn.html>`__). Loud music blaring from a stereo
stacked in the corner is optional but recommended. See `larval
stage <./L.html#larval-stage.html>`__, `hack
mode <./H.html#hack-mode.html>`__.


Trojan horse
=========================



**Trojan horse**: n.

[coined by MIT-hacker-turned-NSA-spook Dan Edwards] A malicious
security-breaking program that is disguised as something benign, such as
a directory lister, archiver, game, or (in one notorious 1990 case on
the Mac) a program to find and destroy viruses! See `back
door <./B.html#back-door.html>`__, `virus <./V.html#virus.html>`__,
`worm <./W.html#worm.html>`__, `phage <./P.html#phage.html>`__,
`mockingbird <./M.html#mockingbird.html>`__.


troll
========================



**troll**

1. v.,n. [From the Usenet group "alt.folklore.urban"] To utter a
posting on `Usenet <./U.html#Usenet.html>`__ designed to attract
predictable responses or `flame <./F.html#flame.html>`__\ s; or, the post
itself. Derives from the phrase “trolling for
`newbie <./N.html#newbie.html>`__\ s” which in turn comes from mainstream
“trolling”, a style of fishing in which one trails bait through a likely
spot hoping for a bite. The well-constructed troll is a post that
induces lots of newbies and flamers to make themselves look even more
clueless than they already do, while subtly conveying to the more savvy
and experienced that it is in fact a deliberate troll. If you don't fall
for the joke, you get to be in on it. See also
`YHBT <./Y.html#YHBT.html>`__.

2. n. An individual who chronically trolls in sense 1; regularly posts
specious arguments, flames or personal attacks to a newsgroup,
discussion list, or in email for no other purpose than to annoy someone
or disrupt a discussion. Trolls are recognizable by the fact that they
have no real interest in learning about the topic at hand - they simply
want to utter flame bait. Like the ugly creatures they are named after,
they exhibit no redeeming characteristics, and as such, they are
recognized as a lower form of life on the net, as in, “Oh, ignore him,
he's just a troll.” Compare `kook <./K.html#kook.html>`__.

3. n. [Berkeley] Computer lab monitor. A popular campus job for CS
students. Duties include helping newbies and ensuring that lab policies
are followed. Probably so-called because it involves lurking in dark
cavelike corners.

Some people claim that the troll (sense 1) is properly a narrower
category than `flame bait <./F.html#flame-bait.html>`__, that a troll is
categorized by containing some assertion that is wrong but not overtly
controversial. See also `Troll-O-Meter <Troll-O-Meter.html>`__.

The use of ‘troll’ in any of these senses is a live metaphor that
readily produces elaborations and combining forms. For example, one not
infrequently sees the warning “Do not feed the troll” as part of a
followup to troll postings.


Troll-O-Meter
====================================



**Troll-O-Meter**: n.

Common Usenet jargon for a notional instrument used to measure the
provocation level of a Usenet `troll <troll.html>`__. “Come on,
everyone! If the above doesn't set off the Troll-O-Meter, we're going to
have to get him to run around with a big blinking sign saying ‘I am a
troll, I’m only in it for the controversy and flames', and shooting
random gobs of Jell-O(tm) at us before the point is proven.” Mentions of
the Troll-O-Meter are often accompanied by an ASCII picture of an arrow
pointing at a numeric scale. Compare
`bogometer <./B.html#bogometer.html>`__,
`Indent-o-Meter <./I.html#Indent-o-Meter.html>`__.


tron
===================



**tron**: v.

[NRL, CMU; prob. fr. the movie *Tron*] To become inaccessible except via
email or talk(1), especially when one is normally available via
telephone or in person. Frequently used in the past tense, as in: “Ran
seems to have tronned on us this week” or “Gee, Ran, glad you were able
to un-tron yourself”. One may also speak of tron mode; compare
`spod <./S.html#spod.html>`__.

Note that many dialects of BASIC have a TRON/TROFF command pair that
enables/disables line number tracing; this has no obvious relationship
to the slang usage.


troughie
==========================



**troughie**: /traw´fee/, n.

[British BBS scene] Synonym for `leech <./L.html#leech.html>`__, sense 1.
The implied metaphor is that of a pig at a trough.

true-hacker
===================



**true-hacker**: n.

[analogy with ‘trufan’ from SF fandom] One who exemplifies the primary
values of hacker culture, esp. competence and helpfulness to other
hackers. A high compliment. “He spent 6 hours helping me bring up UUCP
and netnews on my FOOBAR 4000 last week — manifestly the act of a
true-hacker.” Compare `demigod <./D.html#demigod.html>`__, oppose
`munchkin <./M.html#munchkin.html>`__.


tty
==============


**tty**: /T·T·Y/, /tit´ee/, n.

The latter pronunciation was primarily ITS, but some Unix people say it
this way as well; this pronunciation is *not* considered to have sexual
undertones.

1. A terminal of the teletype variety, characterized by a noisy
mechanical printer, a very limited character set, and poor print
quality. Usage: antiquated (like the TTYs themselves). See also
`bit-paired keyboard <./B.html#bit-paired-keyboard.html>`__.

2. [especially Unix] Any terminal at all; sometimes used to refer to the
particular terminal controlling a given job.

3. [Unix] Any serial port, whether or not the device connected to it is
a terminal; so called because under Unix such devices have names of the
form tty\*. Ambiguity between senses 2 and 3 is common but seldom
bothersome.


tube
========================


**tube**

1. n. A CRT terminal. Never used in the mainstream sense of TV; real
hackers don't watch TV, except for Looney Toons, Rocky & Bullwinkle,
Trek Classic, the Simpsons, Babylon 5, and the occasional cheesy old
swashbuckler movie.

2. [IBM] To send a copy of something to someone else's terminal. “Tube
me that note?”


tube time
====================



**tube time**: n.

Time spent at a terminal or console. More inclusive than hacking time;
commonly used in discussions of what parts of one's environment one uses
most heavily. “I find I'm spending too much of my tube time reading mail
since I started this revision.”


tumbler
==================




**tumbler**: n.

1. [Originally from the Xanadu hypertext project] A tumbler is a `magic
cookie <./M.html#magic-cookie.html>`__ generated as part of a record or
message to give it a unique identity. Usually a tumbler includes an
encoded form of its creation date, but if a software system has more
than one concurrent process that could generate tumblers it must also
include an encoding of the process ID. If tumblers will be shared across
multiple network hosts, they must also include the host name or network
address. Tumblers often include a hash of the rest of the message or
record content so that it is possible to verify the correctness of the
data the tumbler is attached to.

2. Variant text added to spam instances (often in the Subject line) to
make them unique. This kind of tumbler is used to defeat schemes that
check an exact hash of an incoming message against known spam
signatures; it also compromises some kinds of statistical spam
recognition.



tunafish
================

**tunafish**: n.

In hackish lore, refers to the mutated punchline of an age-old joke to
be found at the bottom of the manual pages of tunefs(8) in the original
`BSD <./B.html#BSD.html>`__ 4.2 distribution. The joke was removed in
later releases once commercial sites started using 4.2, but apparently
restored on the 4.4BSD tape and in {Net,Free,Open}BSD. Tunefs relates to
the tuning of file-system parameters for optimum performance, and at the
bottom of a few pages of wizardly inscriptions was a ‘BUGS’ section
consisting of the line “You can tune a file system, but you can't
tunafish”. Variants of this can be seen in other BSD versions, though it
has been excised from some versions by humorless management
`droid <./D.html#droid.html>`__\ s. The [nt]roff source for SunOS 4.1.1
contains a comment apparently designed to prevent this: “Take this out
and a Unix Demon will dog your steps from now until the **time\_t**'s
wrap around.”

[It has since been pointed out that indeed you can tunafish. Usually at
a canning factory... —ESR]
 

tune
================



**tune**: vt.

[from automotive or musical usage] To optimize a program or system for a
particular environment, esp. by adjusting numerical parameters designed
as `hook <./H.html#hook.html>`__\ s for tuning, e.g., by changing
**#define** lines in C. One may tune for time (fastest execution), tune
for space (least memory use), or tune for configuration (most efficient
use of hardware). See `hot spot <./H.html#hot-spot.html>`__,
`hand-hacking <./H.html#hand-hacking.html>`__.


turbo nerd
====================



**turbo nerd**: n.

See `geek <./G.html#geek.html>`__.


Turing tar-pit
==========================


**Turing tar-pit**: n.

1. A place where anything is possible but nothing of interest is
practical. Alan Turing helped lay the foundations of computer science by
showing that all machines and languages capable of expressing a certain
very primitive set of operations are logically equivalent in the kinds
of computations they can carry out, and in principle have capabilities
that differ only in speed from those of the most powerful and elegantly
designed computers. However, no machine or language exactly matching
Turing's primitive set has ever been built (other than possibly as a
classroom exercise), because it would be horribly slow and far too
painful to use. A Turing tar-pit is any computer language or other tool
that shares this property. That is, it's theoretically universal — but
in practice, the harder you struggle to get any real work done, the
deeper its inadequacies suck you in. Compare `bondage-and-discipline
language <./B.html#bondage-and-discipline-language.html>`__.

2. The perennial `holy wars <./H.html#holy-wars.html>`__ over whether
language A or B is the “most powerful”.


turist
=====================



**turist**: /too´rist/, n.

Var. sp. of `tourist <tourist.html>`__, q.v. Also in adjectival form,
‘turistic’. Poss. influenced by `luser <./L.html#luser.html>`__ and
‘Turing’.

Tux
============================



**Tux**

Tux the Penguin is the official emblem of `Linux <./L.html#Linux.html>`__,
This eventuated after a logo contest in 1996, during which Linus
Torvalds endorsed the idea of a penguin logo in a couple of famously
funny `postings <http://www.sjbaker.org/tux/>`__. Linus explained that
he was once bitten by a killer penguin in Australia and has felt a
special affinity for the species ever since. (Linus has since admitted
that he was also thinking of Feathers McGraw, the evil-genius penguin
jewel thief who appeared in a Wallace & Grommit feature cartoon, *The
Wrong Trousers*.)

Larry Ewing `designed <http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/>`__ the
official Tux logo. It has proved a wise choice, amenable to hundreds of
recognizable variations used as emblems of Linux-related projects,
products, and user groups. In fact, Tux has spawned an entire mythology,
of which the `Gospel According to
Tux <http://www.ao.com/~regan/penguins/tux.html>`__ and the mock-epic
poem *Tuxowolf* are among the best-known examples.

There is a ‘real’ Tux — a black-footed penguin resident at the Bristol
Zoo. Several friends of Linux bought a zoo sponsorship for Linus as a
birthday present in 1996.


tweak
===============================



**tweak**: vt.

1. To change slightly, usually in reference to a value. Also used
synonymously with `twiddle <twiddle.html>`__. If a program is almost
correct, rather than figure out the precise problem you might just keep
tweaking it until it works. See `frobnicate <./F.html#frobnicate.html>`__
and `fudge factor <./F.html#fudge-factor.html>`__; also see `shotgun
debugging <./S.html#shotgun-debugging.html>`__.

2. To `tune <tune.html>`__ a program; preferred usage in the U.K.

TWENEX
======================


**TWENEX**: /twe´neks/, n.

The TOPS-20 operating system by `DEC <./D.html#DEC.html>`__ — the second
proprietary OS for the PDP-10 — preferred by most PDP-10 hackers over
TOPS-10 (that is, by those who were not `ITS <./I.html#ITS.html>`__ or
`WAITS <./W.html#WAITS.html>`__ partisans). TOPS-20 began in 1969 as Bolt,
Beranek & Newman's TENEX operating system using special paging hardware.
By the early 1970s, almost all of the systems on the ARPANET ran TENEX.
DEC purchased the rights to TENEX from BBN and began work to make it
their own. The first in-house code name for the operating system was
VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System); when customers started asking
questions, the name was changed to SNARK so DEC could truthfully deny
that there was any project called VIROS. When the name SNARK became
known, the name was briefly reversed to become KRANS; this was quickly
abandoned when someone objected that krans meant ‘funeral wreath’ in
Swedish (though some Swedish speakers have since said it means simply
‘wreath’; this part of the story may be apocryphal). Ultimately DEC
picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system, and it was as
TOPS-20 that it was marketed. The hacker community, mindful of its
origins, quickly dubbed it TWENEX (a contraction of ‘twenty TENEX’),
even though by this point very little of the original TENEX code
remained (analogously to the differences between AT&T V6 Unix and BSD).
DEC people cringed when they heard “TWENEX”, but the term caught on
nevertheless (the written abbreviation ‘20x’ was also used). TWENEX was
successful and very popular; in fact, there was a period in the early
1980s when it commanded as fervent a culture of partisans as Unix or ITS
— but DEC's decision to scrap all the internal rivals to the
`VAX <./V.html#VAX.html>`__ architecture and its relatively stodgy VMS OS
killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to TWENEX's brief day in the sun.
DEC attempted to convince TOPS-20 users to convert to
`VMS <./V.html#VMS.html>`__, but instead, by the late 1980s, most of the
TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to Unix. There is a `TOPS-20 home
page <http://panda.com/tops-20/>`__.


twiddle
====================


**twiddle**: n.

1. Tilde (ASCII 1111110, "~"). Also called squiggle, sqiggle (sic —
pronounced /skig´l/), and twaddle, but twiddle is the most common term.

2. A small and insignificant change to a program. Usually fixes one bug
and generates several new ones (see also `shotgun
debugging <./S.html#shotgun-debugging.html>`__).

3. vt. To change something in a small way. Bits, for example, are often
twiddled. Twiddling a switch or `knobs <./K.html#knobs.html>`__ implies
much less sense of purpose than toggling or tweaking it; see
`frobnicate <./F.html#frobnicate.html>`__. To speak of twiddling a bit
connotes aimlessness, and at best doesn't specify what you're doing to
the bit; ‘toggling a bit’ has a more specific meaning (see `bit
twiddling <./B.html#bit-twiddling.html>`__, `toggle <toggle.html>`__). 4.
Uncommon name for the `twirling baton <twirling-baton.html>`__ prompt.


twilight zone
==============================



**twilight zone**: n., //

[IRC] Notionally, the area of cyberspace where `IRC <./I.html#IRC.html>`__
operators live. An `op <./O.html#op.html>`__ is said to have a “connection
to the twilight zone”.

twink
=================



**twink**: /twink/, n.

1. [Berkeley] A clue-repellant user; the next step beyond a clueless
one.

2. [UCSC] A `read-only user <./R.html#read-only-user.html>`__. Also
reported on the Usenet group "soc.motss"; may derive from gay slang
for a cute young thing with nothing upstairs (compare mainstream
‘chick’).

3. On MU\* systems that specialize in role-playing, refers to behavior
of a (usually inexperienced) player that either ignores rules or social
convention, or disrupts the natural flow of a scene to show off super
powers.

We are informed that in Indian country, the term twink generally refers
to blondes into generic ‘Native American spirituality’. Signs include
Indian jewelry with MADE IN THAILAND stamped on it, crystals, Clairol
black hair, wearing swimsuits to powwows, Cherokee princess grandmas, a
love of *Dances with Wolves*, and a fear of AIM and the NCAI. The twink
nature is everywhere.


twirling baton
===============================



**twirling baton**: n.

[PLATO] The overstrike sequence -/\|\\-/\|\\- which produces an animated
twirling baton. If you output it with a single backspace between
characters, the baton spins in place. If you output the sequence BS SP
between characters, the baton spins from left to right. If you output BS
SP BS BS between characters, the baton spins from right to left. This is
also occasionally called a twiddle prompt.

The twirling baton was a popular component of animated signature files
on the pioneering PLATO educational timesharing system. The **archie**
Internet service is perhaps the best-known baton program today; it uses
the twirling baton as an idler indicating that the program is working on
a query. The twirling baton is also used as a boot progress indicator on
several BSD variants of Unix; if it stops, you're probably going to have
a long and trying day.


two pi
====================


**two pi**: quant.

The number of years it takes to finish one's thesis. Occurs in stories
in the following form: “He started on his thesis; 2 pi years later...”


two-to-the-N
=========================



**two-to-the-N**: quant.

An amount much larger than `N <./N.html#N.html>`__ but smaller than
`infinity <./I.html#infinity.html>`__. “I have 2-to-the-"N" things to do
before I can go out for lunch” means you probably won't show up.


tyop
==========================

**tyop**: n.

[USENET] A deliberate typo for ‘typo’. Used in satirical reference.
“There's a tyop in your posting”. Compare `grilf <./G.html#grilf.html>`__,
`hing <./H.html#hing.html>`__.
