abbrev
======

**abbrev**: /@·breev´/, /@·brev´/, n.

Common abbreviation for ‘abbreviation’.

ABEND
=====

**ABEND**: /a´bend/, /@·bend´/, n.

[ABnormal END]

1. Abnormal termination (of software); `crash <../C/crash.html>`__;
`lossage <../L/lossage.html>`__. Derives from an error message on the
IBM 360; used jokingly by hackers but seriously mainly by `code
grinder <../C/code-grinder.html>`__\ s. Usually capitalized, but may
appear as ‘abend’. Hackers will try to persuade you that ABEND is called
abend because it is what system operators do to the machine late on
Friday when they want to call it a day, and hence is from the German
*Abend* = ‘Evening’.

2. [``alt.callahans``\ ] Absent By Enforced Net Deprivation — used in
the subject lines of postings warning friends of an imminent loss of
Internet access. (This can be because of computer downtime, loss of
provider, moving or illness.) Variants of this also appear: ABVND =
‘Absent By Voluntary Net Deprivation’ and ABSEND = ‘Absent By
Self-Enforced Net Deprivation’ have been sighted.



accumulator
============


**accumulator**: n. obs.

1. Archaic term for a register. On-line use of it as a synonym for
register is a fairly reliable indication that the user has been around
for quite a while and/or that the architecture under discussion is quite
old. The term in full is almost never used of microprocessor registers,
for example, though symbolic names for arithmetic registers beginning in
‘A’ derive from historical use of the term accumulator (and not,
actually, from ‘arithmetic’). Confusingly, though, an ‘A’ register name
prefix may also stand for address, as for example on the Motorola 680x0
family.

2. A register being used for arithmetic or logic (as opposed to
addressing or a loop index), especially one being used to accumulate a
sum or count of many items. This use is in context of a particular
routine or stretch of code. “The FOOBAZ routine uses A3 as an
accumulator.”

3. One's in-basket (esp. among old-timers who might use sense 1). “You
want this reviewed? Sure, just put it in the accumulator.” (See
`stack <../S/stack.html>`__.)


ACK
=====



**ACK**: /ak/, interj.

1. [common; from the ASCII mnemonic for 0000110] Acknowledge. Used to
register one's presence (compare mainstream *Yo!*). An appropriate
response to `ping <../P/ping.html>`__ or `ENQ <../E/ENQ.html>`__.

2. [from the comic strip *Bloom County*] An exclamation of surprised
disgust, esp. in “Ack pffft!” Semi-humorous. Generally this sense is not
spelled in caps (ACK) and is distinguished by a following exclamation
point.

3. Used to politely interrupt someone to tell them you understand their
point (see `NAK <../N/NAK.html>`__). Thus, for example, you might cut
off an overly long explanation with “Ack. Ack. Ack. I get it now”.

4. An affirmative. “Think we ought to ditch that damn NT server for a
Linux box?” “ACK!”

There is also a usage “ACK?” (from sense 1) meaning “Are you there?”,
often used in email when earlier mail has produced no reply, or during a
lull in `talk mode <../T/talk-mode.html>`__ to see if the person has
gone away (the standard humorous response is of course
`NAK <../N/NAK.html>`__, i.e., “I'm not here”).


Acme
====

**Acme**: n.

[from Greek *akme* highest point of perfection or achievement] The
canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate, and non-functional gadgetry —
where Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson (two cartoonists who specialized
in elaborate contraptions) shop. The name has been humorously expanded
as A (or American) Company Making Everything. (In fact, Acme was a real
brand sold from Sears Roebuck catalogs in the early 1900s.) Describing
some X as an “Acme X” either means “This is `insanely
great <../I/insanely-great.html>`__\ ”, or, more likely, “This looks
`insanely great <../I/insanely-great.html>`__ on paper, but in
practice it's really easy to shoot yourself in the foot with it.”
Compare `pistol <../P/pistol.html>`__.

This term, specially cherished by American hackers and explained here
for the benefit of our overseas brethren, comes from the Warner
Brothers' series of “Road-runner” cartoons. In these cartoons, the
famished Wile E. Coyote was forever attempting to catch up with, trap,
and eat the Road-runner. His attempts usually involved one or more
high-technology Rube Goldberg devices — rocket jetpacks, catapults,
magnetic traps, high-powered slingshots, etc. These were usually
delivered in large wooden crates labeled prominently with the Acme name
— which, probably not by coincidence, was the trade name of a peg bar
system for superimposing animation cels used by cartoonists since
forever. Acme devices invariably malfunctioned in improbable and violent
ways.



address harvester
=================


**address harvester**: n.

A robot that searches web pages and/or filters netnews traffic looking
for valid email addresses. Some address harvesters are benign, used only
for compiling address directories. Most, unfortunately, are run by
miscreants compiling address lists to `spam <../S/spam.html>`__.
Address harvesters can be foiled by a
`teergrube <../T/teergrube.html>`__.

adger
=====

**adger**: /aj´r/, vt.

[UCLA mutant of `nadger <../N/nadger.html>`__, poss. also from the
middle name of an infamous `tenured graduate
student <../T/tenured-graduate-student.html>`__] To make a bonehead
move with consequences that could have been foreseen with even slight
mental effort. E.g., “He started removing files and promptly adgered the
whole project”. Compare `dumbass attack <../D/dumbass-attack.html>`__.


ad-hockery
==========

**ad-hockery**: /ad·hok'@r·ee/, n.

[Purdue]

1. Gratuitous assumptions made inside certain programs, esp. expert
systems, which lead to the appearance of semi-intelligent behavior but
are in fact entirely arbitrary. For example, fuzzy-matching of input
tokens that might be typing errors against a symbol table can make it
look as though a program knows how to spell.

2. Special-case code to cope with some awkward input that would
otherwise cause a program to `choke <../C/choke.html>`__, presuming
normal inputs are dealt with in some cleaner and more regular way.

Also called ad-hackery, ad-hocity (/ad-hos'@-tee/), ad-crockery. See
also `ELIZA effect <../E/ELIZA-effect.html>`__.

.. image:: ../_static/73-10-31.png

This is `ad-hockery <ad-hockery.html>`__ in action.

(The next cartoon in the Crunchly saga is
`74-08-18 <./W.html#water-MIPS>`__. The previous one
is `73-07-29 <./B.html#bug>`__.)


admin
=====

**admin**: /ad·min´/, n.

Short for ‘administrator’; very commonly used in speech or on-line to
refer to the systems person in charge on a computer. Common
constructions on this include sysadmin and site admin (emphasizing the
administrator's role as a site contact for email and news) or newsadmin
(focusing specifically on news). Compare
`postmaster <../P/postmaster.html>`__, `sysop <../S/sysop.html>`__,
`system mangler <../S/system-mangler.html>`__.


ADVENT
======


**ADVENT**: /ad´vent/, n.

The prototypical computer adventure game, first designed by Will
Crowther on the `PDP-10 <../P/PDP-10.html>`__ in the mid-1970s as an
attempt at computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and expanded into a
puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods at Stanford in 1976. (Woods had been
one of the authors of `INTERCAL <../I/INTERCAL.html>`__.) Now better
known as Adventure or Colossal Cave Adventure, but the
`TOPS-10 <../T/TOPS-10.html>`__ operating system permitted only
six-letter filenames in uppercase. See also
`vadding <../V/vadding.html>`__, `Zork <../Z/Zork.html>`__, and
`Infocom <../I/Infocom.html>`__.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style since expected in text
adventure games, and popularized several tag lines that have become
fixtures of hacker-speak: “A huge green fierce snake bars the way!” “I
see no X here” (for some noun X). “You are in a maze of twisty little
passages, all alike.” “You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all
different.” The ‘magic words’ `xyzzy <../X/xyzzy.html>`__ and
`plugh <../P/plugh.html>`__ also derive from this game.

Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the Mammoth &
Flint Ridge cave system; it actually *has* a Colossal Cave and a
Bedquilt as in the game, and the Y2 that also turns up is cavers' jargon
for a map reference to a secondary entrance.

adware
======

**adware**: n.

Software which is free to download and use but includes pop-up banner
ads somewhere. See also `-ware <../W/suffix-ware.html>`__.


AFAIK
=====

**AFAIK**: //, n.

[Usenet; common] Abbrev. for “As Far As I Know”. There is a variant
AFAICT “As Far As I Can Tell”; where AFAIK suggests that the writer
knows his knowledge is limited, AFAICT suggests that he feels his
knowledge is as complete as anybody else's but that the best available
knowledge does not support firm conclusions.


AFJ
===

**AFJ**: //, n.

Written-only abbreviation for “April Fool's Joke”. Elaborate April
Fool's hoaxes are a long-established tradition on Usenet and Internet;
see `kremvax <../K/kremvax.html>`__ for an example. In fact, April
Fool's Day is the *only* seasonal holiday consistently marked by
customary observances on Internet and other hacker networks.


AFK
===

**AFK**

[MUD] Abbrev. for “Away From Keyboard”. Used to notify others that you
will be momentarily unavailable online. eg. “Let's not go kill that
frost giant yet, I need to go AFK to make a phone call”. Often MUDs will
have a command to politely inform others of your absence when they try
to talk with you. The term is not restricted to MUDs, however, and has
become common in many chat situations, from IRC to Unix talk.


AI-complete
===========

**AI-complete**: /A·I k@m·pleet'/, adj.

[MIT, Stanford: by analogy with NP-complete (see
`NP- <../N/NP-.html>`__)] Used to describe problems or subproblems in
AI, to indicate that the solution presupposes a solution to the ‘strong
AI problem’ (that is, the synthesis of a human-level intelligence). A
problem that is AI-complete is, in other words, just too hard.

Examples of AI-complete problems are ‘The Vision Problem’ (building a
system that can see as well as a human) and ‘The Natural Language
Problem’ (building a system that can understand and speak a natural
language as well as a human). These may appear to be modular, but all
attempts so far (2003) to solve them have foundered on the amount of
context information and ‘intelligence’ they seem to require. See also
`gedanken <../G/gedanken.html>`__.


AI
==

**AI**: /A·I/, n.

Abbreviation for ‘Artificial Intelligence’, so common that the full form
is almost never written or spoken among hackers.

airplane rule
=============


**airplane rule**: n.

“Complexity increases the possibility of failure; a twin-engine airplane
has twice as many engine problems as a single-engine airplane.” By
analogy, in both software and electronics, the rule that simplicity
increases robustness. It is correspondingly argued that the right way to
build reliable systems is to put all your eggs in one basket, after
making sure that you've built a really *good* basket. See also `KISS
Principle <../K/KISS-Principle.html>`__,
`elegant <../E/elegant.html>`__.

Alderson loop
=============

**Alderson loop**: n.

[Intel] A special version of an `infinite
loop <../I/infinite-loop.html>`__ where there is an exit condition
available, but inaccessible in the current implementation of the code.
Typically this is created while debugging user interface code. An
example would be when there is a menu stating, “Select 1-3 or 9 to quit”
and 9 is not allowed by the function that takes the selection from the
user.

This term received its name from a programmer who had coded a modal
message box in MSAccess with no Ok or Cancel buttons, thereby disabling
the entire program whenever the box came up. The message box had the
proper code for dismissal and even was set up so that when the
non-existent Ok button was pressed the proper code would be called.

aliasing bug
============



**aliasing bug**: n.

A class of subtle programming errors that can arise in code that does
dynamic allocation, esp. via malloc(3) or equivalent. If several
pointers address (are aliases for) a given hunk of storage, it may
happen that the storage is freed or reallocated (and thus moved) through
one alias and then referenced through another, which may lead to subtle
(and possibly intermittent) lossage depending on the state and the
allocation history of the malloc `arena <arena.html>`__. Avoidable by
use of allocation strategies that never alias allocated core, or by use
of higher-level languages, such as `LISP <../L/LISP.html>`__, which
employ a garbage collector (see `GC <../G/GC.html>`__). Also called a
`stale pointer bug <../S/stale-pointer-bug.html>`__. See also
`precedence lossage <../P/precedence-lossage.html>`__, `smash the
stack <../S/smash-the-stack.html>`__, `fandango on
core <../F/fandango-on-core.html>`__, `memory
leak <../M/memory-leak.html>`__, `memory
smash <../M/memory-smash.html>`__, `overrun
screw <../O/overrun-screw.html>`__, `spam <../S/spam.html>`__.

Historical note: Though this term is nowadays associated with C
programming, it was already in use in a very similar sense in the
Algol-60 and FORTRAN communities in the 1960s.


Alice and Bob
=============

**Alice and Bob**: n.

The archetypal individuals used as examples in discussions of
cryptographic protocols. Originally, theorists would say something like:
“A communicates with someone who claims to be B, So to be sure, A tests
that B knows a secret number K. So A sends to B a random number X. B
then forms Y by encrypting X under key K and sends Y back to A” Because
this sort of thing is quite hard to follow, theorists stopped using the
unadorned letters A and B to represent the main players and started
calling them Alice and Bob. So now we say “Alice communicates with
someone claiming to be Bob, and to be sure, Alice tests that Bob knows a
secret number K. Alice sends to Bob a random number X. Bob then forms Y
by encrypting X under key K and sends Y back to Alice”. A whole
mythology rapidly grew up around the metasyntactic names; see
`http://www.conceptlabs.co.uk/alicebob.html <http://www.conceptlabs.co.uk/alicebob.html>`__.

In Bruce Schneier's definitive introductory text *Applied Cryptography*
(2nd ed., 1996, John Wiley & Sons, ISBN 0-471-11709-9) he introduced a
table of dramatis personae headed by Alice and Bob. Others include Carol
(a participant in three- and four-party protocols), Dave (a participant
in four-party protocols), Eve (an eavesdropper), Mallory (a malicious
active attacker), Trent (a trusted arbitrator), Walter (a warden), Peggy
(a prover) and Victor (a verifier). These names for roles are either
already standard or, given the wide popularity of the book, may be
expected to quickly become so.

All hardware sucks, all software sucks.
=======================================

**All hardware sucks, all software sucks.**: prov.

[from `scary devil monastery <../S/scary-devil-monastery.html>`__] A
general recognition of the fallibility of any computer system, ritually
intoned as an attempt to quell incipient `holy
wars <../H/holy-wars.html>`__. It is a common response to any sort of
`bigot <../B/bigot.html>`__. When discussing
`Wintel <../W/Wintel.html>`__ systems, however, it is often snidely
appended with, ‘but some suck more than others.’


all your base are belong to us
==============================


**all your base are belong to us**

A declaration of victory or superiority. The phrase stems from a 1991
adaptation of Toaplan's “Zero Wing” shoot-'em-up arcade game for the
Sega Genesis game console. A brief introduction was added to the opening
screen, and it has what many consider to be the worst
Japanese-to-English translation in video game history. The introduction
shows the bridge of a starship in chaos as a Borg-like figure named CATS
materializes and says, “How are you gentlemen!! All your base are belong
to us.” [sic] In 2001, this amusing mistranslation spread virally
through the Internet, bringing with it a slew of JPEGs and a movie of
hacked photographs, each showing a street sign, store front, package
label, etc. hacked to read “All your base are belong to us” or one of
the other many supremely dopey lines from the game (such as “Somebody
set up usthe bomb!!!” or “What happen?”). When these phrases are used
properly, the overall effect is both screamingly funny and somewhat
chilling, reminiscent of the B movie “They Live”.

The original has been generalized to “All your X are belong to us”,
where X is filled in to connote a sinister takeover of some sort. Thus,
“When Joe signed up for his new job at Yoyodyne, he had to sign a
draconian NDA. It basically said: All your code are belong to us.” Has
many of the connotations of “Resistance is futile; you will be
assimilated” (see `Borg <../B/Borg.html>`__). Considered silly, and
most likely to be used by the type of person that finds `Jeff
K. <../J/Jeff-K-.html>`__ hilarious.

alpha geek
===========

**alpha geek**: n.

[from animal ethologists' alpha male] The most technically accomplished
or skillful person in some implied context. “Ask Larry, he's the alpha
geek here.”

alpha particles
================

**alpha particles**: n.

See `bit rot <../B/bit-rot.html>`__.

alt bit
=======

**alt bit**: /awlt bit/, adj.

See `meta bit <../M/meta-bit.html>`__.

alt
===


**alt**: /awlt/

1. n. The alt shift key on an IBM PC or `clone <../C/clone.html>`__
keyboard; see `bucky bits <../B/bucky-bits.html>`__, sense 2 (though
typical PC usage does not simply set the 0200 bit).

2. n. The option key on a Macintosh; use of this term usually reveals
that the speaker hacked PCs before coming to the Mac (see also `feature
key <../F/feature-key.html>`__, which is sometimes *incorrectly* called
‘alt’).

3. The ``alt`` hierarchy on Usenet, the tree of newsgroups created by
users without a formal vote and approval procedure. There is a myth, not
entirely implausible, that ``alt`` is acronymic for “anarchists,
lunatics, and terrorists”; but in fact it is simply short for
“alternative”.

4. n.,obs. Rare alternate name for the ASCII ESC character (ASCII
0011011). This use, derives, with the alt key itself, from archaic
PDP-10 operating systems, especially `ITS <../I/ITS.html>`__.

Aluminum Book
=============

**Aluminum Book**: n.

[MIT] *Common LISP: The Language*, by Guy L. Steele Jr. (Digital Press,
first edition 1984, second edition 1990). Note that due to a technical
screwup some printings of the second edition are actually of a color the
author describes succinctly as “yucky green”. See also `book
titles <../B/book-titles.html>`__.


ambimouseterous
===============

**ambimouseterous**: /am·b@·mows´ter·us/, /am·b@·mows´trus/, adj

[modeled on ambidextrous] Able to use a mouse with either hand.

Amiga
=====

**Amiga**: n

A series of personal computer models originally sold by Commodore, based
on 680x0 processors, custom support chips and an operating system that
combined some of the best features of Macintosh and Unix with
compatibility with neither.

The Amiga was released just as the personal computing world standardized
on IBM-PC clones. This prevented it from gaining serious market share,
despite the fact that the first Amigas had a substantial technological
lead on the IBM XTs of the time. Instead, it acquired a small but
zealous population of enthusiastic hackers who dreamt of one day
unseating the clones (see `Amiga Persecution
Complex <Amiga-Persecution-Complex.html>`__). The traits of this
culture are both spoofed and illuminated in `The BLAZE Humor
Viewer <http://www.blazemonger.com/BM/>`__. The strength of the Amiga
platform seeded a small industry of companies building software and
hardware for the platform, especially in graphics and video applications
(see `video toaster <../V/video-toaster.html>`__).

Due to spectacular mismanagement, Commodore did hardly any R&D, allowing
the competition to close Amiga's technological lead. After Commodore
went bankrupt in 1994 the technology passed through several hands, none
of whom did much with it. However, the Amiga is still being produced in
Europe under license and has a substantial number of fans, which will
probably extend the platform's life considerably.


Amiga Persecution Complex
=========================

**Amiga Persecution Complex**: n.

The disorder suffered by a particularly egregious variety of
`bigot <../B/bigot.html>`__, those who believe that the marginality of
their preferred machine is the result of some kind of industry-wide
conspiracy (for without a conspiracy of some kind, the eminent
superiority of their beloved shining jewel of a platform would obviously
win over all, market pressures be damned!) Those afflicted are prone to
engaging in `flame war <../F/flame-war.html>`__\ s and calling for
boycotts and mailbombings. Amiga Persecution Complex is by no means
limited to Amiga users; NeXT, `NeWS <../N/NeWS.html>`__,
`OS/2 <../O/OS-2.html>`__, Macintosh, `LISP <../L/LISP.html>`__, and
`GNU <../G/GNU.html>`__ users are also common victims.
`Linux <../L/Linux.html>`__ users used to display symptoms very
frequently before Linux started winning; some still do. See also
`newbie <../N/newbie.html>`__, `troll <../T/troll.html>`__, `holy
wars <../H/holy-wars.html>`__, `weenie <../W/weenie.html>`__, `Get a
life! <../G/Get-a-life-.html>`__.

amper
=====

**amper**: n.

Common abbreviation for the name of the ampersand (‘&’, ASCII 0100110)
character. See `ASCII <ASCII.html>`__ for other synonyms.


amp off
=======


**amp off**: vt.

[Purdue] To run in `background <../B/background.html>`__. From the
Unix shell ‘&’ operator.


and there was much rejoicing
============================

**and there was much rejoicing**

[from the movie *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*.]

Acknowledgement of a notable accomplishment. Something long-awaited,
widely desired, possibly unexpected but secretly wished-for, with a
suggestion that something about the problem (and perhaps the steps
necessary to make it go away) was deeply disturbing to hacker
sensibilities.

In person, the phrase is almost invariably pronounced with the same
portentious intonation as the movie. The customary in-person (approving)
response is a weak and halfhearted “Yaaaay...”, with one index finger
raised like a flag and moved in a small circle. The reason for this,
like most of the Monty Python *oeuvre*, cannot easily be explained
outside its original context.

Example: "changelog entry #436: with the foo driver brain damage taken
care of, finally obsoleted BROKEN\_EVIL\_KLUDGE. Removed from source
tree. (And there was much rejoicing)."


Angband
=======

**Angband**: n., /ang´band/

Like `nethack <../N/nethack.html>`__, `moria <../M/moria.html>`__,
and `rogue <../R/rogue.html>`__, one of the large freely distributed
Dungeons-and-Dragons-like simulation games, available for a wide range
of machines and operating systems. The name is from Tolkien's Pits of
Angband (compare `elder days <../E/elder-days.html>`__,
`elvish <../E/elvish.html>`__). Has been described as “Moria on
steroids”; but, unlike Moria, many aspects of the game are customizable.
This leads many hackers and would-be hackers into fooling with these
instead of doing productive work. There are many Angband variants, of
which the most notorious is probably the rather whimsical Zangband. In
this game, when a key that does not correspond to a command is pressed,
the game will display “Type ? for help” 50% of the time. The other 50%
of the time, random error messages including “An error has occurred
because an error of type 42 has occurred” and “Windows 95 uninstalled
successfully” will be displayed. Zangband also allows the player to kill
Santa Claus (who has some really good stuff, but also has a lot of
friends), “Bull Gates”, and Barney the Dinosaur (but be watchful; Barney
has a nasty case of halitosis). There is an official angband home page
at
`http://thangorodrim.angband.org/ <http://thangorodrim.angband.org/>`__
and a zangband one at
`http://www.zangband.org/ <http://www.zangband.org/>`__. See also
`Random Number God <../R/Random-Number-God.html>`__.


angle brackets
==============


**angle brackets**: n.

Either of the characters ``<`` (ASCII 0111100) and ``>`` (ASCII 0111110)
(ASCII less-than or greater-than signs). Typographers in the `Real
World <../R/Real-World.html>`__ use angle brackets which are either
taller and slimmer (the ISO lang 〈 and rang 〉 characters), or
significantly smaller (single or double guillemets) than the less-than
and greater-than signs. See `broket <../B/broket.html>`__,
`ASCII <ASCII.html>`__.


angry fruit salad
=================


A bad visual-interface design that uses too many colors. (This term
derives, of course, from the bizarre day-glo colors found in canned
fruit salad.) Too often one sees similar effects from interface
designers using color window systems such as `X <../X/X.html>`__;
there is a tendency to create displays that are flashy and
attention-getting but uncomfortable for long-term use.


annoybot
========

**annoybot**: /@·noy·bot/, n.

[IRC] See `bot <../B/bot.html>`__.

annoyware
=========

**annoyware**: n.

A type of `shareware <../S/shareware.html>`__ that frequently disrupts
normal program operation to display requests for payment to the author
in return for the ability to disable the request messages. (Also called
nagware) The requests generally require user action to acknowledge the
message before normal operation is resumed and are often tied to the
most frequently used features of the software. See also
`careware <../C/careware.html>`__,
`charityware <../C/charityware.html>`__,
`crippleware <../C/crippleware.html>`__,
`freeware <../F/freeware.html>`__, `FRS <../F/FRS.html>`__,
`guiltware <../G/guiltware.html>`__,
`postcardware <../P/postcardware.html>`__, and
`-ware <../W/suffix-ware.html>`__; compare
`payware <../P/payware.html>`__.


ANSI standard
=============

**ANSI standard**: /an´see stan´d@rd/

The ANSI standard usage of ANSI standard refers to any practice which is
typical or broadly done. It's most appropriately applied to things that
everyone does that are not quite regulation. For example: ANSI standard
shaking of a laser printer cartridge to get extra life from it, or the
ANSI standard word tripling in names of usenet alt groups.

This usage derives from the American National Standards Institute. ANSI,
along with the International Organization for Standards (ISO),
standardized the C programming language (see
`K&R <../K/K-ampersand-R.html>`__, `Classic
C <../C/Classic-C.html>`__), and promulgates many other important
software standards.


ANSI standard pizza
===================

**ANSI standard pizza**: /an´see stan´d@rd peet´z@/

[CMU] Pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Coined allegedly because most pizzas
ordered by CMU hackers during some period leading up to mid-1990 were of
that flavor. See also `rotary debugger <../R/rotary-debugger.html>`__;
compare `ISO standard cup of
tea <../I/ISO-standard-cup-of-tea.html>`__.


anti-idiotarianism
================== 

**anti-idiotarianism**: n.

[very common] Opposition to idiots of all political stripes. First
coined in the `blog <../B/blog.html>`__ named `Little Green
Footballs <http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/weblog.php>`__ as
part of a post expressing disgust with inane responses to post-9/11
Islamic terrorism. Anti-idiotarian wrath has focused on Islamic
terrorists and their sympathizers in the Western political left, but
also routinely excoriated right-wing politicians backing repressive
’anti-terror‘ legislation and Christian religious figures who (in the
blogosphere's view of the matter) have descended nearly to the level of
jihad themselves.

AOL!
====


**AOL!**: n.

[Usenet] Common synonym for “Me, too!” alluding to the legendary
propensity of America Online users to utter contentless “Me, too!”
postings. The number of exclamation points following varies from zero to
five or so. The pseudo-HTML

    <AOL>Me, too!</AOL>

is also frequently seen. See also `September that never
ended <../S/September-that-never-ended.html>`__.


app
===

**app**: /ap/, n.

Short for ‘application program’, as opposed to a systems program. Apps
are what systems vendors are forever chasing developers to create for
their environments so they can sell more boxes. Hackers tend not to
think of the things they themselves run as apps; thus, in hacker
parlance the term excludes compilers, program editors, games, and
messaging systems, though a user would consider all those to be apps.
(Broadly, an app is often a self-contained environment for performing
some well-defined task such as ‘word processing’; hackers tend to prefer
more general-purpose tools.) See `killer
app <../K/killer-app.html>`__; oppose `tool <../T/tool.html>`__,
`operating system <../O/operating-system.html>`__.

Archimedes
==========

**Archimedes**

The world's first RISC microcomputer, available only in the British
Commonwealth and europe. Built in 1987 in Great Britain by Acorn
Computers, it was legendary for its use of the ARM-2 microprocessor as a
CPU. Many a novice hacker in the Commonwealth first learnt his or her
skills on the Archimedes, since it was specifically designed for use in
schools and educational institutions. Owners of Archimedes machines are
often still treated with awe and reverence. Familiarly, “archi”.


arena
=====

**arena**: n.

[common; Unix] The area of memory attached to a process by brk(2) and
sbrk(2) and used by malloc(3) as dynamic storage. So named from a
**malloc: corrupt arena** message emitted when some early versions
detected an impossible value in the free block list. See `overrun
screw <../O/overrun-screw.html>`__, `aliasing
bug <aliasing-bug.html>`__, `memory leak <../M/memory-leak.html>`__,
`memory smash <../M/memory-smash.html>`__, `smash the
stack <../S/smash-the-stack.html>`__.


arg
===

**arg**: /arg/, n.

Abbreviation for ‘argument’ (to a function), used so often as to have
become a new word (like ‘piano’ from ‘pianoforte’). “The sine function
takes 1 arg, but the arc-tangent function can take either 1 or 2 args.”
Compare `param <../P/param.html>`__, `parm <../P/parm.html>`__,
`var <../V/var.html>`__.

ARMM
====

**ARMM**: n.

[acronym, ‘Automated Retroactive Minimal Moderation’] A Usenet
`cancelbot <../C/cancelbot.html>`__ created by Dick Depew of Munroe
Falls, Ohio. ARMM was intended to automatically cancel posts from
anonymous-posting sites. Unfortunately, the robot's recognizer for
anonymous postings triggered on its own automatically-generated control
messages! Transformed by this stroke of programming ineptitude into a
monster of Frankensteinian proportions, it broke loose on the night of
March 30, 1993 and proceeded to `spam <../S/spam.html>`__
``news.admin.policy`` with a recursive explosion of over 200 messages.

ARMM's bug produced a recursive `cascade <../C/cascade.html>`__ of
messages each of which mechanically added text to the ID and Subject and
some other headers of its parent. This produced a flood of messages in
which each header took up several screens and each message ID and
subject line got longer and longer and longer.

Reactions varied from amusement to outrage. The pathological messages
crashed at least one mail system, and upset people paying line charges
for their Usenet feeds. One poster described the ARMM debacle as
“instant Usenet history” (also establishing the term
`despew <../D/despew.html>`__), and it has since been widely cited as
a cautionary example of the havoc the combination of good intentions and
incompetence can wreak on a network. The Usenet thread on the subject is
`archived
here <http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=tweekC4qM0A.H3q%40netcom.com>`__.
Compare `Great Worm <../G/Great-Worm.html>`__; `sorcerer's apprentice
mode <../S/sorcerers-apprentice-mode.html>`__. See also `software
laser <../S/software-laser.html>`__, `network
meltdown <../N/network-meltdown.html>`__.


armor-plated
============


**armor-plated**: n.

Syn. for `bulletproof <../B/bulletproof.html>`__.


asbestos cork award
===================

**asbestos cork award**: n.

Once, long ago at MIT, there was a `flamer <../F/flamer.html>`__ so
consistently obnoxious that another hacker designed, had made, and
distributed posters announcing that said flamer had been nominated for
the asbestos cork award. (Any reader in doubt as to the intended
application of the cork should consult the etymology under
`flame <../F/flame.html>`__.) Since then, it is agreed that only a
select few have risen to the heights of bombast required to earn this
dubious dignity — but there is no agreement on *which* few.

asbestos
========

**asbestos**: adj.

[common] Used as a modifier to anything intended to protect one from
`flame <../F/flame.html>`__\ s; also in other highly
`flame <../F/flame.html>`__-suggestive usages. See, for example,
`asbestos longjohns <asbestos-longjohns.html>`__ and `asbestos cork
award <asbestos-cork-award.html>`__.


asbestos longjohns
==================

**asbestos longjohns**: n.

Notional garments donned by `Usenet <../U/Usenet.html>`__ posters just
before emitting a remark they expect will elicit
`flamage <../F/flamage.html>`__. This is the most common of the
`asbestos <asbestos.html>`__ coinages. Also asbestos underwear,
asbestos overcoat, etc.

ASCII art
=========

**ASCII art**: n.

The fine art of drawing diagrams using the ASCII character set (mainly
``|``, ``-``, ``/``, ``\``, and ``+``). Also known as character graphics
or ASCII graphics; see also `boxology <../B/boxology.html>`__. Here is
a serious example:

There is an important subgenre of ASCII art that puns on the standard
character names in the fashion of a rebus.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Within humorous ASCII art, there is for some reason an entire
flourishing subgenre of pictures of silly cows. Four of these are
reproduced in the examples above, here are three more:

The next step beyond static tableaux in ASCII art is ASCII animation.
There are not many large examples of this; perhaps the best known is the
ASCII animation of the original *Star Wars* movie at
`http://www.asciimation.co.nz/ <http://www.asciimation.co.nz/>`__.

There is a newsgroup, ``alt.ascii-art``, devoted to this genre; however,
see also `warlording <../W/warlording.html>`__.

ASCIIbetical order
==================

**ASCIIbetical order**: /as´kee·be'·t@·kl or´dr/, adj.,n.

Used to indicate that data is sorted in ASCII collated order rather than
alphabetical order. This lexicon is sorted in something close to
ASCIIbetical order, but with case ignored and entries beginning with
non-alphabetic characters moved to the beginning.


ASCII
=====

**ASCII**: /as´kee/, n.

[originally an acronym (American Standard Code for Information
Interchange) but now merely conventional] The predominant character set
encoding of present-day computers. The standard version uses 7 bits for
each character, whereas most earlier codes (including early drafts of
ASCII prior to June 1961) used fewer. This change allowed the inclusion
of lowercase letters — a major `win <../W/win.html>`__ — but it did
not provide for accented letters or any other letterforms not used in
English (such as the German sharp-S ß. or the ae-ligature æ which is a
letter in, for example, Norwegian). It could be worse, though. It could
be much worse. See `EBCDIC <../E/EBCDIC.html>`__ to understand how. A
history of ASCII and its ancestors is at
`http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html <http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html>`__.

Computers are much pickier and less flexible about spelling than humans;
thus, hackers need to be very precise when talking about characters, and
have developed a considerable amount of verbal shorthand for them. Every
character has one or more names — some formal, some concise, some silly.
Common jargon names for ASCII characters are collected here. See also
individual entries for `bang <../B/bang.html>`__,
`excl <../E/excl.html>`__, `open <../O/open.html>`__,
`ques <../Q/ques.html>`__, `semi <../S/semi.html>`__,
`shriek <../S/shriek.html>`__, `splat <../S/splat.html>`__,
`twiddle <../T/twiddle.html>`__, and `Yu-Shiang Whole
Fish <../Y/Yu-Shiang-Whole-Fish.html>`__.

This list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII pronunciation
guide. Single characters are listed in ASCII order; character pairs are
sorted in by first member. For each character, common names are given in
rough order of popularity, followed by names that are reported but
rarely seen; official ANSI/CCITT names are surrounded by brokets: <>.
Square brackets mark the particularly silly names introduced by
`INTERCAL <../I/INTERCAL.html>`__. The abbreviations “l/r” and “o/c”
stand for left/right and “open/close” respectively. Ordinary
parentheticals provide some usage information.

The pronunciation of ``#`` as ‘pound’ is common in the U.S. but a bad
idea; `Commonwealth Hackish <../C/Commonwealth-Hackish.html>`__ has
its own, rather more apposite use of ‘pound sign’ (confusingly, on
British keyboards the £ happens to replace ``#``; thus Britishers
sometimes call ``#`` on a U.S.-ASCII keyboard ‘pound’, compounding the
American error). The U.S. usage derives from an old-fashioned commercial
practice of using a ``#`` suffix to tag pound weights on bills of
lading. The character is usually pronounced ‘hash’ outside the U.S.
There are more culture wars over the correct pronunciation of this
character than any other, which has led to the `ha ha only
serious <../H/ha-ha-only-serious.html>`__ suggestion that it be
pronounced “shibboleth” (see Judges 12:6 in an Old Testament or Tanakh).

The ‘uparrow’ name for circumflex and ‘leftarrow’ name for underline are
historical relics from archaic ASCII (the 1963 version), which had these
graphics in those character positions rather than the modern punctuation
characters.

The ‘swung dash’ or ‘approximation’ sign (∼) is not quite the same as
tilde ~ in typeset material, but the ASCII tilde serves for both
(compare `angle brackets <angle-brackets.html>`__).

Some other common usages cause odd overlaps. The ``#``, ``$``, ``>``,
and ``&`` characters, for example, are all pronounced “hex” in different
communities because various assemblers use them as a prefix tag for
hexadecimal constants (in particular, ``#`` in many
assembler-programming cultures, ``$`` in the 6502 world, ``>`` at Texas
Instruments, and ``&`` on the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and some Z80
machines). See also `splat <../S/splat.html>`__.

The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the world's
other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits look more
and more like a serious `misfeature <../M/misfeature.html>`__ as the
use of international networks continues to increase (see `software
rot <../S/software-rot.html>`__). Hardware and software from the U.S.
still tends to embody the assumption that ASCII is the universal
character set and that characters have 7 bits; this is a major irritant
to people who want to use a character set suited to their own languages.
Perversely, though, efforts to solve this problem by proliferating
‘national’ character sets produce an evolutionary pressure to use a
*smaller* subset common to all those in use.


astroturfing
============

**astroturfing**: n.

1. The use of paid shills to create the impression of a popular
movement, through means like letters to newspapers from soi-disant
‘concerned citizens’, paid opinion pieces, and the formation of
grass-roots lobbying groups that are actually funded by a PR group
(AstroTurf is fake grass; hence the term). See also `sock
puppet <../S/sock-puppet.html>`__, `tentacle <../T/tentacle.html>`__.

2. What an individual posting to a public forum under an assumed name is
said to be doing.

This term became common among hackers after it came to light in early
1998 that Microsoft had attempted to use such tactics to forestall the
U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust action against the company. The
maneuver backfired horribly, angering a number of state
attorneys-general enough to induce them to go public with plans to join
the Federal suit. It also set anybody defending Microsoft on the net for
the accusation “You're just astroturfing!”.


atomic
======

**atomic**: adj.

[from Gk. *atomos*, indivisible]

1. Indivisible; cannot be split up. For example, an instruction may be
said to do several things ‘atomically’, i.e., all the things are done
immediately, and there is no chance of the instruction being
half-completed or of another being interspersed. Used esp. to convey
that an operation cannot be screwed up by interrupts. “This routine
locks the file and increments the file's semaphore atomically.”

2. [primarily techspeak] Guaranteed to complete successfully or not at
all, usu. refers to database transactions. If an error prevents a
partially-performed transaction from proceeding to completion, it must
be “backed out”, as the database must not be left in an inconsistent
state.

Computer usage, in either of the above senses, has none of the
connotations that ‘atomic’ has in mainstream English (i.e. of particles
of matter, nuclear explosions etc.).


attoparsec
==========

**attoparsec**: n.

About an inch. *atto-* is the standard SI prefix for multiplication by
``10-18``. A parsec (parallax-second) is 3.26 light-years; an attoparsec
is thus ``3.26 ×    10-18`` light years, or about 3.1 cm (thus, 1
attoparsec/\ `microfortnight <../M/microfortnight.html>`__ equals
about 1 inch/sec). This unit is reported to be in use (though probably
not very seriously) among hackers in the U.K. See
`micro- <../M/micro-.html>`__.


Aunt Tillie
===========

**Aunt Tillie**: n.

[linux-kernel mailing list] The archetypal non-technical user, one's
elderly and scatterbrained maiden aunt. Invoked in discussions of
usability for people who are not hackers and geeks; one sees references
to the “Aunt Tillie test”.

AUP
===

**AUP**: /A·U·P/

Abbreviation, “Acceptable Use Policy”. The policy of a given ISP which
sets out what the ISP considers to be (un)acceptable uses of its
Internet resources.


autobogotiphobia
================

**autobogotiphobia**: /aw´toh·boh·got\`@·foh´bee·@/

n. See `bogotify <../B/bogotify.html>`__.


autoconfiscate
==============

**autoconfiscate**

To set up or modify a source-code `distribution <../D/distribution.html>`__ so that it configures and
builds using the GNU project's autoconf/automake/libtools suite. Among
open-source hackers, a mere running binary of a program is not
considered a full release; what's interesting is a source tree that can
be built into binaries using standard tools. Since the mid-1990s,
autoconf and friends been the standard way to adapt a distribution for
portability so that it can be built on multiple operating systems
without change.

automagically
=============

**automagically**: /aw·toh·maj´i·klee/, adv.

Automatically, but in a way that, for some reason (typically because it
is too complicated, or too ugly, or perhaps even too trivial), the
speaker doesn't feel like explaining to you. See
`magic <../M/magic.html>`__. “The C-INTERCAL compiler generates C,
then automagically invokes cc(1) to produce an executable.”

This term is quite old, going back at least to the mid-70s in jargon and
probably much earlier. The word ‘automagic’ occurred in advertising (for
a shirt-ironing gadget) as far back as the late 1940s.


avatar
======

**avatar**: n.

[in Hindu mythology, the incarnation of a god]

1. Among people working on virtual reality and
`cyberspace <../C/cyberspace.html>`__ interfaces, an avatar is an icon
or representation of a user in a shared virtual reality. The term is
sometimes used on `MUD <../M/MUD.html>`__\ s.

2. [CMU, Tektronix] `root <../R/root.html>`__,
`superuser <../S/superuser.html>`__. There are quite a few Unix
machines on which the name of the superuser account is ‘avatar’ rather
than ‘root’. This quirk was originated by a CMU hacker who found the
terms root and superuser unimaginative, and thought ‘avatar’ might
better impress people with the responsibility they were accepting.

awk
===

**awk**: /awk/

1. n. [Unix techspeak] An interpreted language for massaging text data
developed by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan (the name
derives from their initials). It is characterized by C-like syntax, a
declaration-free approach to variable typing and declarations,
associative arrays, and field-oriented text processing. See also
`Perl <../P/Perl.html>`__.

2. n. Editing term for an expression awkward to manipulate through
normal `regexp <../R/regexp.html>`__ facilities (for example, one
containing a `newline <../N/newline.html>`__).

3. vt. To process data using awk(1).
