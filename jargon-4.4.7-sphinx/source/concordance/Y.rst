YABA
========




**YABA**: /ya´b@/, n.

[Cambridge] Yet Another Bloody Acronym. Whenever some program is being
named, someone invariably suggests that it be given a name that is
acronymic. The response from those with a trace of originality is to
remark ironically that the proposed name would then be
‘YABA-compatible’. Also used in response to questions like “What is
WYSIWYG?” See also `TLA <./T.html#TLA.html>`__.



YAFIYGI
========


**YAFIYGI**: /yaf´ee·y@·gee/, adj.

[coined in response to WYSIWYG] Describes the command-oriented
ed/vi/nroff/TeX style of word processing or other user interface, the
opposite of `WYSIWYG <./W.html#WYSIWYG.html>`__. Stands for “You asked for
it, you got it”, because what you actually asked for is often not
apparent until long after it is too late to do anything about it. Used
to denote perversity (“Real Programmers use YAFIYGI tools...and *like*
it!”) or, less often, a necessary tradeoff (“Only a YAFIYGI tool can
have full programmable flexibility in its interface.”).

This precise sense of “You asked for it, you got it” seems to have first
appeared in Ed Post's classic parody *Real Programmers don't use Pascal*
(see `Real Programmers <./R.html#Real-Programmer.html>`__); the acronym
is a more recent invention.



YA-
=====



**YA-**: abbrev.

[Yet Another] In hackish acronyms this almost invariably expands to
`Yet Another<Yet-Another.html>`__, following the precedent set by
Unix yacc(1) (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler). See
`YABA<YABA.html>`__.


yak shaving
============




**yak shaving**

[MIT AI Lab, after 2000: orig. probably from a *Ren & Stimpy episode.*]
Any seemingly pointless activity which is actually necessary to solve a
problem which solves a problem which, several levels of recursion later,
solves the real problem you're working on.

YAUN
========



**YAUN**: /yawn/, n.

[Acronym for ‘Yet Another Unix Nerd’] Reported from the San Diego
Computer Society (predominantly a microcomputer users' group) as a
good-natured punning insult aimed at Unix zealots.


yellow card
==============




**yellow card**: n.

See `green card <./G.html#green-card.html>`__.


yellow wire
==============


**yellow wire**: n.

[IBM] Repair wires used when connectors (especially ribbon connectors)
got broken due to some schlemiel pinching them, or to reconnect cut
traces after the FE mistakenly cut one. Compare `blue
wire <./B.html#blue-wire.html>`__, `purple
wire <./P.html#purple-wire.html>`__, `red wire <./R.html#red-wire.html>`__.



Yet Another
============



**Yet Another**: adj.

[From Unix's yacc(1), ‘Yet Another Compiler-Compiler’, a LALR parser
generator]

1. Of your own work: A humorous allusion often used in titles to
acknowledge that the topic is not original, though the content is. As in
‘Yet Another AI Group’ or ‘Yet Another Simulated Annealing Algorithm’.

2. Of others' work: Describes something of which there are already far
too many. See also `YA- <YA-.html>`__, `YABA <YABA.html>`__,
`YAUN <YAUN.html>`__.


YHBT
===========


**YHBT**: //

[Usenet: very common] Abbreviation: You Have Been Trolled (see
`troll <./T.html#troll.html>`__, sense 1). Especially used in “YHBT. YHL.
HAND.”, which is widely understood to expand to “You Have Been Trolled.
You Have Lost. Have A Nice Day”. You are quite likely to see this if you
respond incautiously to a flame-provoking post that was obviously
floated as sucker bait.


YKYBHTLW
===========



**YKYBHTLW**: //, abbrev.

Abbreviation of ‘You know you've been hacking too long when...’, which
became established on the Usenet group "alt.folklore.computers" during
extended discussion of the indicated entry in the Jargon File.


YMMV
=====




**YMMV**: //, cav.

Abbreviation for `Your mileage may
vary <Your-mileage-may-vary.html>`__ common on Usenet.



You are not expected to understand this
========================================



**You are not expected to understand this**: cav.

[Unix] The canonical comment describing something
`magic <./M.html#magic.html>`__ or too complicated to bother explaining
properly. From an infamous comment in the context-switching code of the
V6 Unix kernel. Dennis Ritchie has `explained this in
detail <http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/odd.html>`__.


You know you've been hacking too long when
=============================================


**You know you've been hacking too long when**

The set-up line for a genre of one-liners told by hackers about
themselves. These include the following:

*  not only do you check your email more often than your paper mail, but you remember your `network address <./N.html#network-address.html>`__ faster than your postal one.

*  your `SO <./S.html#SO.html>`__ kisses you on the neck and the first thing you think is “Uh, oh, `priority
   interrupt <./P.html#priority-interrupt.html>`__.”

*  you go to balance your checkbook and discover that you're doing it in octal.

* your computers have a higher street value than your car.

* in your universe, ‘round numbers’ are powers of 2, not 10.

* more than once, you have woken up recalling a dream in some programming language.

* you see the word “Oxford” and mentally trip over the fact that ‘r’ is not a hex digit.

* you realize you have never seen half of your best friends.

A `list <http://albrecht.ecn.purdue.edu/~taylor/humor/hack.html>`__ of
these can be found by searching for this phrase on the web.

[An early version of this entry said “All but one of these have been
reliably reported as hacker traits (some of them quite often). Even
hackers may have trouble spotting the ringer.” The ringer was balancing
one's checkbook in octal, which I made up out of whole cloth. Although
more respondents picked that one out as fiction than any of the others,
I also received multiple independent reports of its actually happening,
most famously to Grace Hopper while she was working with BINAC in 1949.

Your mileage may vary
======================


**Your mileage may vary**: cav.

[from the standard disclaimer attached to EPA mileage ratings by
American car manufacturers]

1. A ritual warning often found in Unix freeware distributions.
Translates roughly as “Hey, I tried to write this portably, but who
*knows* what'll happen on your system?”

2. More generally, a qualifier attached to advice. “I find that sending
flowers works well, but your mileage may vary.”

Yow!
=======




**Yow!**: /yow/, interj.

[from “Zippy the Pinhead” comix] A favored hacker expression of humorous
surprise or emphasis. “Yow! Check out what happens when you twiddle the
foo option on this display hack!”.


yoyo mode
============



**yoyo mode**: n.

The state in which the system is said to be when it rapidly alternates
several times between being up and being down. Interestingly (and
perhaps not by coincidence), many hardware vendors give out free yoyos
at Usenix exhibits.

Sun Microsystems gave out logoized yoyos at SIGPLAN '88. Tourists
staying at one of Atlanta's most respectable hotels were subsequently
treated to the sight of 200 of the country's top computer scientists
testing yo-yo algorithms in the lobby.


Yu-Shiang Whole Fish
======================



**Yu-Shiang Whole Fish**: /yoo·shyang hohl fish/, n. obs.

The character gamma (extended SAIL ASCII 0001001), which with a loop in
its tail looks like a little fish swimming down the page. The term is
actually the name of a Chinese dish in which a fish is cooked whole (not
`parsed <./P.html#parse.html>`__ ) and covered with Yu-Shiang (or
Yu-Hsiang, or in modern Pinyin transliteration yuxiang) sauce. Usage:
primarily by people on the MIT LISP Machine, which could display this
character on the screen. Tends to elicit incredulity from people who
hear about it second-hand.

Yu Shiang Whole Fish is alive and well in Unicode as U+0263 LATIN SMALL
LETTER GAMMA (as opposed to the actual Greek letter at U+03B3, which
usually has a loopless glyph; the form of U+0263 is consistently loopy).
This symbol is included in Unicode as a Latin letter because it is used
in the International Phonetic Alphabet. In the IPA, gamma represents a
voiced velar fricative, the sound commonly transcribed “gh” in Arabic or
Klingon.
