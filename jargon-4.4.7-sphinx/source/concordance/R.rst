rabbit job
==============


**rabbit job**: n.

[Cambridge] A batch job that does little, if any, real work, but creates
one or more copies of itself, breeding like rabbits. Compare
`wabbit <../W/wabbit.html>`__, `fork bomb <../F/fork-bomb.html>`__.


rainbow series
=================


**rainbow series**: n.

Any of several series of technical manuals distinguished by cover color.
The original rainbow series was the NCSC security manuals (see `Orange
Book <../O/Orange-Book.html>`__). These are now available `via the
web <http://www.radium.ncsc.mil/tpep/library/rainbow/>`__. the term has
also been commonly applied to the PostScript reference set. Which books
are meant by “\ *the* rainbow series” unqualified is thus dependent on
one's local technical culture.


rain dance
==============

**rain dance**: n.

1. Any ceremonial action taken to correct a hardware problem, with the
expectation that nothing will be accomplished. This especially applies
to reseating printed circuit boards, reconnecting cables, etc. “I can't
boot up the machine. We'll have to wait for Greg to do his rain dance.”

2. Any arcane sequence of actions performed with computers or software
in order to achieve some goal; the term is usually restricted to rituals
that include both an `incantation <../I/incantation.html>`__ or two
and physical activity or motion. Compare `magic <../M/magic.html>`__,
`voodoo programming <../V/voodoo-programming.html>`__, `black
art <../B/black-art.html>`__, `cargo cult
programming <../C/cargo-cult-programming.html>`__, `wave a dead
chicken <../W/wave-a-dead-chicken.html>`__; see also `casting the
runes <../C/casting-the-runes.html>`__.


random
=============


**random**: adj.

1. Unpredictable (closest to mathematical definition); weird. “The
system's been behaving pretty randomly.”

2. Assorted; undistinguished. “Who was at the conference?” “Just a bunch
of random business types.”

3. (pejorative) Frivolous; unproductive; undirected. “He's just a random
loser.”

4. Incoherent or inelegant; poorly chosen; not well organized. “The
program has a random set of misfeatures.” “That's a random name for that
function.” “Well, all the names were chosen pretty randomly.”

5. In no particular order, though deterministic. “The I/O channels are
in a pool, and when a file is opened one is chosen randomly.”

6. Arbitrary. “It generates a random name for the scratch file.”

7. Gratuitously wrong, i.e., poorly done and for no good apparent
reason. For example, a program that handles file name defaulting in a
particularly useless way, or an assembler routine that could easily have
been coded using only three registers, but redundantly uses seven for
values with non-overlapping lifetimes, so that no one else can invoke it
without first saving four extra registers. What
`randomness <randomness.html>`__!

8. n. A random hacker; used particularly of high-school students who
soak up computer time and generally get in the way.

9. n. Anyone who is not a hacker (or, sometimes, anyone not known to the
hacker speaking); the noun form of sense 2. “I went to the talk, but the
audience was full of randoms asking bogus questions”.

10. n. (occasional MIT usage) One who lives at Random Hall. See also
`J. Random <../J/J--Random.html>`__, `some random
X <../S/some-random-X.html>`__.

11. [UK] Conversationally, a non sequitur or something similarly
out-of-the-blue. As in: “Stop being so random!” This sense equates to
‘hatstand’, taken from the Viz comic character “Roger Irrelevant - He's
completely Hatstand.”

randomness
==================


**randomness**: n.

1. An inexplicable misfeature; gratuitous inelegance.

2. A `hack <../H/hack.html>`__ or `crock <../C/crock.html>`__ that
depends on a complex combination of coincidences (or, possibly, the
combination upon which the crock depends for its accidental failure to
malfunction). “This hack can output characters 40--57 by putting the
character in the four-bit accumulator field of an XCT and then
extracting six bits — the low 2 bits of the XCT opcode are the right
thing.” “What randomness!”

3. Of people, synonymous with flakiness. The connotation is that the
person so described is behaving weirdly, incompetently, or
inappropriately for reasons which are (a) too tiresome to bother
inquiring into, (b) are probably as inscrutable as quantum phenomena
anyway, and (c) are likely to pass with time. “Maybe he has a real
complaint, or maybe it's just randomness. See if he calls back.”

Despite the negative connotations of most jargon uses of this term have,
it is worth noting that randomness can actually be a valuable resource,
very useful for applications in cryptography and elsewhere. Computers
are so thoroughly deterministic that they have a hard time generating
high-quality randomness, so hackers have sometimes felt the need to
built special-purpose contraptions for this purpose alone. One
well-known website offers random bits `generated by radioactive
decay <http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/>`__. Another derives random bits
from `chaotic systems <http://lavarnd.org/>`__ in analog electronics.
Originally, the latter site got its random bits by doing photometry on
lava lamps. Hackers invariably found this hilarious. If you have to ask
why, you'll never get it.)


Random Number God
===================

**Random Number God**

[rec.games.roguelike.angband; often abbreviated ‘RNG’] The malign force
which lurks behind the random number generator in
`Angband <../A/Angband.html>`__ (and by extension elsewhere). A dark
god that demands sacrifices and toys with its victims. “I just found a
really great item; I suppose the RNG is about to punish me...”
Apparently, Angband's random number generator occasionally gets locked
in a repetition, so you get something with a 3% chance happening 8 times
in a row. Improbable, but far too common to be pure chance. Compare
`Shub-Internet <../S/Shub-Internet.html>`__.

random numbers
================
 

**random numbers**: n.

When one wishes to specify a large but random number of things, and the
context is inappropriate for `N <../N/N.html>`__, certain numbers are
preferred by hacker tradition (that is, easily recognized as
placeholders). These include the following:

+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 17    | Long described at MIT as ‘the least random number’; see also 23. This may be Discordian in origin, or it may be related to some in-jokes about `17 and “yellow pig” <http://www.vinc17.org/yp17_eng.html>`__ propagated by the mathematician Michael Spivak.   |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 23    | Sacred number of Eris, Goddess of Discord (along with 17 and 5).                                                                                                                                                                                               |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 37    | The most random two-digit number is 37, When groups of people are polled to pick a “random number between 1 and 100”, the most commonly chosen number is 37.                                                                                                   |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 42    | The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything (“what is 6 times 9”, correct in base 13). (This answer is perhaps not completely fortuitous; in Kabbalism, the true unspeakable name of God is said to have 42 characters.)         |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 69    | From the sexual act. This one was favored in MIT's ITS culture.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 105   | 69 hex = 105 decimal, and 69 decimal = 105 octal.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 666   | In Christian mythology, the Number of the Beast.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

`Discordianism <../D/Discordianism.html>`__ or consult your pineal
gland. See also `for values of <../F/for-values-of.html>`__.
 
rape
========



**rape**: vt.

1. To `screw <../S/screw.html>`__ someone or something, violently; in
particular, to destroy a program or information irrecoverably. Often
used in describing file-system damage. “So-and-so was running a program
that did absolute disk I/O and ended up raping the master directory.”

2. To strip a piece of hardware for parts.

3. [CMU/Pitt] To mass-copy files from an anonymous ftp site. “Last night
I raped Simtel's dskutl directory.”



rare mode
============


**rare mode**: adj.

[Unix] CBREAK mode (character-by-character with interrupts enabled).
Distinguished from `raw mode <raw-mode.html>`__ and `cooked
mode <../C/cooked-mode.html>`__; the phrase “a sort of half-cooked
(rare?) mode” is used in the V7/BSD manuals to describe the mode. Usage:
rare.


rasterbation
=================


**rasterbation**: n.

[portmanteau: raster + masturbation] The gratuitous use of
computer-generated images and effects in movies and graphic art which
would have been better without them. Especially employed as a term of
abuse by Photoshop/GIMP users and graphic artists.
 

raster blaster
=================
 

**raster blaster**: n.

[Cambridge] Specialized hardware for `bitblt <../B/bitblt.html>`__
operations (a `blitter <../B/blitter.html>`__). Allegedly inspired by
‘Rasta Blasta’, British slang for the sort of portable stereo Americans
call a ‘boom box’ or ‘ghetto blaster’.
 
raster burn
==============
 

**raster burn**: n.

Eyestrain brought on by too many hours of looking at low-res, poorly
tuned, or glare-ridden monitors, esp. graphics monitors. See `terminal
illness <../T/terminal-illness.html>`__.
 

rat belt
==================
 

**rat belt**: n.

A cable tie, esp. the sawtoothed, self-locking plastic kind that you can
remove only by cutting (as opposed to a random twist of wire or a twist
tie or one of those humongous metal clip frobs). Small cable ties are
mouse belts.
 

rat dance
=====================
 

**rat dance**: n.

[From the `Dilbert <../D/Dilbert.html>`__ comic strip of November 14,
1995] A `hacking run <../H/hacking-run.html>`__ that produces results
which, while superficially coherent, have little or nothing to do with
its original objectives. There are strong connotations that the coding
process and the objectives themselves were pretty
`random <random.html>`__. (In the original comic strip, the Ratbert is
invited to dance on Dilbert's keyboard in order to produce bugs for him
to fix, and authors a Web browser instead.) Compare `Infinite-Monkey
Theorem <../I/Infinite-Monkey-Theorem.html>`__.

This term seems to have become widely recognized quite rapidly after the
original strip, a fact which testifies to Dilbert's huge popularity
among hackers. All too many find the perverse incentives and Kafkaesque
atmosphere of Dilbert's mythical workplace reflective of their own
experiences.
 

rathole
===============
 

**rathole**

[from the English idiom “down a rathole” for a waste of money or time] A
technical subject that is known to be able to absorb infinite amounts of
discussion time without more than an infinitesimal probability of
arrival at a conclusion or consensus. “That's a rathole” (or just
“Rathole!”) is considered a pre-emptive bid to change the subject. The
difference between ratholes and `religious
issues <religious-issues.html>`__ is that a holy war cannot be
pre-empted in this way. Canonical examples are XML namespaces and
open-source licensing.
 

ratio site
================
  

**ratio site**

[warez d00dz] An FTP site storing pirated files where one must first
upload something before being able to download. There is a ratio, based
on bytes or files count, between the uploads and download. For instance,
on a 2:1 site, to download a 4 Mb file, one must first upload at least 2
Mb of files. The hotter the contents of the server are, the smaller the
ratio is. More often than not, the server refuses uploads because its
disk is full, making it useless for downloading — or the connection
magically breaks after one has uploaded a large amount of files, just
before the downloading phase begins. See also `banner
site <../B/banner-site.html>`__, `leech
mode <../L/leech-mode.html>`__.
 

rave
=============
 

**rave**: vi.

[WPI]

1. To persist in discussing a specific subject.

2. To speak authoritatively on a subject about which one knows very
little.

3. To complain to a person who is not in a position to correct the
difficulty.

4. To purposely annoy another person verbally.

5. To evangelize. See `flame <../F/flame.html>`__.

6. Also used to describe a less negative form of blather, such as
friendly bullshitting. ‘Rave’ differs slightly from
`flame <../F/flame.html>`__ in that rave implies that it is the
persistence or obliviousness of the person speaking that is annoying,
while `flame <../F/flame.html>`__ implies somewhat more strongly that
the tone or content is offensive as well.

 

rave on!
================
 
 

**rave on!**: imp.

Sarcastic invitation to continue a `rave <rave.html>`__, often by
someone who wishes the raver would get a clue but realizes this is
unlikely.
 

ravs
======================

 

**ravs**: /ravz/, Chinese ravs, n.

[primarily MIT/Boston usage] Jiao-zi (steamed or boiled) or Guo-tie
(pan-fried). A Chinese appetizer, known variously in the plural as
dumplings, pot stickers (the literal translation of guo-tie), and
(around Boston) ‘Peking Ravioli’. The term rav is short for ‘ravioli’,
and among hackers always means the Chinese kind rather than the Italian
kind. Both consist of a filling in a pasta shell, but the Chinese kind
includes no cheese, uses a thinner pasta, has a pork-vegetable filling
(good ones include Chinese chives), and is cooked differently, either by
steaming or frying. A rav or dumpling can be cooked any way, but a
potsticker is always the pan-fried kind (so called because it sticks to
the frying pot and has to be scraped off). “Let's get hot-and-sour soup
and three orders of ravs.” See also `oriental
food <../O/oriental-food.html>`__.
 

raw mode
==================
 

**raw mode**: n.

A mode that allows a program to transfer bits directly to or from an I/O
device (or, under `bogus <../B/bogus.html>`__ operating systems that
make a distinction, a disk file) without any processing, abstraction, or
interpretation by the operating system. Compare `rare
mode <rare-mode.html>`__, `cooked mode <../C/cooked-mode.html>`__.
This is techspeak under Unix, jargon elsewhere.
 

RBL
=====

**RBL**: /R·B·L/

Abbreviation: “Realtime Blackhole List”. A service that allows people to
blacklist sites for emitting `spam <../S/spam.html>`__, and makes the
blacklist available in real time to electronic-mail transport programs
that know how to use RBL so they can filter out mail from those sites.
Drastic (and controversial) but effective. There is an `RBL home
page <http://mail-abuse.org/rbl/usage.html>`__.

 

rc file
=============
 

**rc file**: /R·C fi:l/, n.

[Unix: from runcom files on the `CTSS <../C/CTSS.html>`__ system
1962-63, via the startup script ``/etc/rc``] Script file containing
startup instructions for an application program (or an entire operating
system), usually a text file containing commands of the sort that might
have been invoked manually once the system was running but are to be
executed automatically each time the system starts up. See also `dot
file <../D/dot-file.html>`__, `profile <../P/profile.html>`__ (sense
1).
 

README file
=====================
 

**README file**: n.

Hacker's-eye introduction traditionally included in the top-level
directory of a Unix source distribution, containing a pointer to more
detailed documentation, credits, miscellaneous revision history, notes,
etc. In the Mac and PC worlds, software is not usually distributed in
source form, and the README is more likely to contain user-oriented
material like last-minute documentation changes, error workarounds, and
restrictions. When asked, hackers invariably relate the README
convention to the famous scene in Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures In
Wonderland* in which Alice confronts magic munchies labeled “Eat Me” and
“Drink Me”.

The file may be named README, or READ.ME, or rarely ReadMe or readme.txt
or some other variant. The all-upper-case spellings, however, are
universal among Unix programmers. By ancient tradition, real source
files have all-lowercase names and all-uppercase is reserved for
metadata, comments, and grafitti. This is functional; because 'A' sorts
before 'a' in ASCII, the README will appear in directory listings before
any source file.
 
read-only user
================
 

**read-only user**: n.

Describes a `luser <../L/luser.html>`__ who uses computers almost
exclusively for reading Usenet, bulletin boards, and/or email, rather
than writing code or purveying useful information. See
`twink <../T/twink.html>`__, `terminal
junkie <../T/terminal-junkie.html>`__, `lurker <../L/lurker.html>`__.
 
real estate
==============

**real estate**: n.

May be used for any critical resource measured in units of area. Most
frequently used of chip real estate, the area available for logic on the
surface of an integrated circuit (see also
`nanoacre <../N/nanoacre.html>`__). May also be used of floor space in
a `dinosaur pen <../D/dinosaur-pen.html>`__, or even space on a
crowded desktop (whether physical or electronic).

 

real hack
==================
 

**real hack**: n.

A `crock <../C/crock.html>`__. This is sometimes used affectionately;
see `hack <../H/hack.html>`__.
 

real
================
 

**real**: adj.

Not simulated. Often used as a specific antonym to
`virtual <../V/virtual.html>`__ in any of its jargon senses.
 
reality check
==================
 

**reality check**: n.

1. The simplest kind of test of software or hardware; doing the
equivalent of asking it what ``2 + 2`` is and seeing if you get 4. The
software equivalent of a `smoke test <../S/smoke-test.html>`__.

2. The act of letting a `real user <real-user.html>`__ try out
prototype software. Compare `sanity check <../S/sanity-check.html>`__.

 

reality-distortion field
==============================
 

**reality-distortion field**: n.

An expression used to describe the persuasive ability of managers like
Steve Jobs (the term originated at Apple in the 1980s to describe his
peculiar charisma). Those close to these managers become passionately
committed to possibly insane projects, without regard to the
practicality of their implementation or competitive forces in the
marketplace.
 

real operating system
==========================
 

**real operating system**: n.

The sort the speaker is used to. People from the BSDophilic academic
community are likely to issue comments like “System V? Why don't you use
a *real* operating system?”, people from the commercial/industrial Unix
sector are known to complain “BSD? Why don't you use a *real* operating
system?”, and people from IBM object “Unix? Why don't you use a *real*
operating system?” Only `MS-DOS <../M/MS-DOS.html>`__ is universally
considered unreal. See `holy wars <../H/holy-wars.html>`__,
`religious issues <religious-issues.html>`__,
`proprietary <../P/proprietary.html>`__, `Get a real
computer! <../G/Get-a-real-computer-.html>`__
 

Real Programmer
==================
 

**Real Programmer**: n.

[indirectly, from the book *Real Men Don't Eat Quiche*] A particular
sub-variety of hacker: one possessed of a flippant attitude toward
complexity that is arrogant even when justified by experience. The
archetypal Real Programmer likes to program on the `bare
metal <../B/bare-metal.html>`__ and is very good at same, remembers the
binary opcodes for every machine he has ever programmed, thinks that
HLLs are sissy, and uses a debugger to edit his code because full-screen
editors are for wimps. Real Programmers aren't satisfied with code that
hasn't been tuned into a state of `tense <../T/tense.html>`__\ ness
just short of rupture. Real Programmers never use comments or write
documentation: “If it was hard to write”, says the Real Programmer, “it
should be hard to understand.” Real Programmers can make machines do
things that were never in their spec sheets; in fact, they are seldom
really happy unless doing so. A Real Programmer's code can awe with its
fiendish brilliance, even as its crockishness appalls. Real Programmers
live on junk food and coffee, hang line-printer art on their walls, and
terrify the crap out of other programmers — because someday, somebody
else might have to try to understand their code in order to change it.
Their successors generally consider it a `Good
Thing <../G/Good-Thing.html>`__ that there aren't many Real Programmers
around any more. For a famous (and somewhat more positive) portrait of a
Real Programmer, see `The Story of Mel' <../story-of-mel.html>`__ in
Appendix A. The term itself was popularized by a letter to the editor in
the July 1983 Datamation titled *Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal* by
Ed Post, still circulating on Usenet and Internet in on-line form.

Typing *Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal* into a web search engine
should turn up a copy.
 

Real Soon Now
=================
 

**Real Soon Now**: adv.

[orig. from SF's fanzine community, popularized by Jerry Pournelle's
column in *BYTE*]

1. Supposed to be available (or fixed, or cheap, or whatever) real soon
now according to somebody, but the speaker is quite skeptical.

2. When one's gods, fates, or other time commitments permit one to get
to it (in other words, don't hold your breath). Often abbreviated RSN.
Compare `copious free time <../C/copious-free-time.html>`__.
 

real time
================
 

**real time**

1. [techspeak] adj. Describes an application which requires a program to
respond to stimuli within some small upper limit of response time
(typically milli- or microseconds). Process control at a chemical plant
is the `canonical <../C/canonical.html>`__ example. Such applications
often require special operating systems (because everything else must
take a back seat to response time) and speed-tuned hardware.

2. adv. In jargon, refers to doing something while people are watching
or waiting. “I asked her how to find the calling procedure's program
counter on the stack and she came up with an algorithm in real time.”
 

real user
==================
 

**real user**: n.

1. A commercial user. One who is paying *real* money for his computer
usage.

2. A non-hacker. Someone using the system for an explicit purpose (a
research project, a course, etc.) other than pure exploration. See
`user <../U/user.html>`__. Hackers who are also students may also be
real users. “I need this fixed so I can do a problem set. I'm not
complaining out of randomness, but as a real user.” See also
`luser <../L/luser.html>`__.

 

Real World
=================
 

**Real World**: n.

1. Those institutions at which ‘programming’ may be used in the same
sentence as ‘FORTRAN’, ‘\ `COBOL <../C/COBOL.html>`__\ ’, ‘RPG’,
‘\ `IBM <../I/IBM.html>`__\ ’, ‘DBASE’, etc. Places where programs do
such commercially necessary but intellectually uninspiring things as
generating payroll checks and invoices.

2. The location of non-programmers and activities not related to
programming.

3. A bizarre dimension in which the standard dress is shirt and tie and
in which a person's working hours are defined as 9 to 5 (see `code
grinder <../C/code-grinder.html>`__).

4. Anywhere outside a university. “Poor fellow, he's left MIT and gone
into the Real World.” Used pejoratively by those not in residence there.
In conversation, talking of someone who has entered the Real World is
not unlike speaking of a deceased person. It is also noteworthy that on
the campus of Cambridge University in England, there is a gaily-painted
lamp-post which bears the label ‘REALITY CHECKPOINT’. It marks the
boundary between university and the Real World; check your notions of
reality before passing. This joke is funnier because the Cambridge
‘campus’ is actually coextensive with the center of Cambridge town. See
also `fear and loathing <../F/fear-and-loathing.html>`__,
`mundane <../M/mundane.html>`__, and
`uninteresting <../U/uninteresting.html>`__.

reaper
=======

**reaper**: n.

A `prowler <../P/prowler.html>`__ that removes files. A file removed
in this way is said to have been reaped.
 

recompile the world
====================
 

**recompile the world**

The surprisingly large amount of work that needs to be done as the
result of any small but globally visible program change. “The world” may
mean the entirety of some huge program, or may in theory refer to every
program of a certain class in the entire known universe. For instance,
“Add one #define to stdio.h, and you have to recompile the world.” This
means that any minor change to the standard-I/O header file
theoretically mandates recompiling every C program in existence, even if
only to verify that the change didn't screw something else up. In
practice, you may not actually have to recompile the world, but the
implication is that some human cleverness is required to figure out what
parts can be safely left out.

 

rectangle slinger
======================
 

**rectangle slinger**: n.

See `polygon pusher <../P/polygon-pusher.html>`__.

 

recursion
================
 

**recursion**: n.

See `recursion <recursion.html>`__. See also `tail
recursion <../T/tail-recursion.html>`__.
 

recursive acronym
====================

 

**recursive acronym**: n.

A hackish (and especially MIT) tradition is to choose
acronyms/abbreviations that refer humorously to themselves or to other
acronyms/abbreviations. The original of the breed may have been TINT
(“TINT Is Not TECO”). The classic examples were two MIT editors called
EINE (“EINE Is Not EMACS”) and ZWEI (“ZWEI Was EINE Initially”). More
recently, there is a Scheme compiler called LIAR (Liar Imitates Apply
Recursively), and `GNU <../G/GNU.html>`__ (q.v., sense 1) stands for
“GNU's Not Unix!” — and a company with the name Cygnus, which expands to
“Cygnus, Your GNU Support” (though Cygnus people say this is a
`backronym <../B/backronym.html>`__). The GNU recursive acronym may
have been patterned on XINU, “XINU Is Not Unix” — a particularly nice
example because it is a mirror image, a backronym, and a recursive
acronym. See also `mung <../M/mung.html>`__,
`EMACS <../E/EMACS.html>`__.

 

red wire
==============
 

**red wire**: n.

[IBM] Patch wires installed by programmers who have no business mucking
with the hardware. It is said that the only thing more dangerous than a
hardware guy with a code patch is a `softy <../S/softy.html>`__ with a
soldering iron.... Compare `blue wire <../B/blue-wire.html>`__,
`yellow wire <../Y/yellow-wire.html>`__, `purple
wire <../P/purple-wire.html>`__.
 

regexp
=============
 

**regexp**: /reg´eksp/, n.

[Unix] (alt.: regex or reg-ex)

1. Common written and spoken abbreviation for regular expression, one of
the wildcard patterns used, e.g., by Unix utilities such as grep(1),
sed(1), and awk(1). These use conventions similar to but more elaborate
than those described under `glob <../G/glob.html>`__. For purposes of
this lexicon, it is sufficient to note that regexps also allow
complemented character sets using ``^``; thus, one can specify ‘any
non-alphabetic character’ with **[^A-Za-z]**.

2. Name of a well-known PD regexp-handling package in portable C,
written by revered Usenetter Henry Spencer.
 

register dancing
=================

**register dancing**: n.

Many older processor architectures suffer from a serious shortage of
general-purpose registers. This is especially a problem for
compiler-writers, because their generated code needs places to store
temporaries for things like intermediate values in expression
evaluation. Some designs with this problem, like the Intel 80x86, do
have a handful of special-purpose registers that can be pressed into
service, providing suitable care is taken to avoid unpleasant side
effects on the state of the processor: while the special-purpose
register is being used to hold an intermediate value, a delicate minuet
is required in which the previous value of the register is saved and
then restored just before the official function (and value) of the
special-purpose register is again needed.
 

rehi
===========
 

**rehi**

[IRC, MUD] “Hello again.” Very commonly used to greet people upon
returning to an IRC channel after `channel
hopping <../C/channel-hopping.html>`__.
 

RE
=======

 

**RE**: /R·E/, n.

Common spoken and written shorthand for `regexp <regexp.html>`__.
 

reincarnation, cycle of
========================
 

**reincarnation, cycle of**: n.

See `cycle of reincarnation <../C/cycle-of-reincarnation.html>`__.
 

reinvent the wheel
====================
 

**reinvent the wheel**: v.

To design or implement a tool equivalent to an existing one or part of
one, with the implication that doing so is silly or a waste of time.
This is often a valid criticism. On the other hand, automobiles don't
use wooden rollers, and some kinds of wheel have to be reinvented many
times before you get them right. On the third hand, people reinventing
the wheel do tend to come up with the moral equivalent of a trapezoid
with an offset axle.
 

relay rape
==============

 

**relay rape**: n.

The hijacking of a third party's unsecured mail server to deliver
`spam <../S/spam.html>`__.
 

religion of CHI
=================

 

**religion of CHI**: /ki:/, n.

[Case Western Reserve University] Yet another hackish parody religion
(see also `Church of the
SubGenius <../C/Church-of-the-SubGenius.html>`__,
`Discordianism <../D/Discordianism.html>`__). In the mid-70s, the
canonical “Introduction to Programming” courses at CWRU were taught in
Algol, and student exercises were punched on cards and run on a Univac
1108 system using a homebrew operating system named CHI. The religion
had no doctrines and but one ritual: whenever the worshiper noted that a
digital clock read 11:08, he or she would recite the phrase “It is
11:08; ABS, ALPHABETIC, ARCSIN, ARCCOS, ARCTAN.” The last five words
were the first five functions in the appropriate chapter of the Algol
manual; note the special pronunciations /obz/ and /ark´sin/ rather than
the more common /ahbz/ and /ark´si:n/. Using an alarm clock to warn of
11:08's arrival was `considered
harmful <../C/considered-harmful.html>`__.
 

religious issues
===================

**religious issues**: n.

Questions which seemingly cannot be raised without touching off `holy
wars <../H/holy-wars.html>`__, such as “What is the best operating
system (or editor, language, architecture, shell, mail reader, news
reader)?”, “What about that Heinlein guy, eh?”, “What should we add to
the new Jargon File?” See `holy wars <../H/holy-wars.html>`__; see
also `theology <../T/theology.html>`__, `bigot <../B/bigot.html>`__,
and compare `rathole <rathole.html>`__.

This term is a prime example of `ha ha only
serious <../H/ha-ha-only-serious.html>`__. People actually develop the
most amazing and religiously intense attachments to their tools, even
when the tools are intangible. The most constructive thing one can do
when one stumbles into the crossfire is mumble `Get a
life! <../G/Get-a-life-.html>`__ and leave — unless, of course, one's
*own* unassailably rational and obviously correct choices are being
slammed.

 

replicator
===============

**replicator**: n.

Any construct that acts to produce copies of itself; this could be a
living organism, an idea (see `meme <../M/meme.html>`__), a program
(see `quine <../Q/quine.html>`__, `worm <../W/worm.html>`__,
`wabbit <../W/wabbit.html>`__, `fork bomb <../F/fork-bomb.html>`__,
and `virus <../V/virus.html>`__), a pattern in a cellular automaton
(see `life <../L/life.html>`__, sense 1), or (speculatively) a robot
or `nanobot <../N/nanobot.html>`__. It is even claimed by some that
`Unix <../U/Unix.html>`__ and `C <../C/C.html>`__ are the symbiotic
halves of an extremely successful replicator; see `Unix
conspiracy <../U/Unix-conspiracy.html>`__.
 

reply
============

**reply**: n.

See `followup <../F/followup.html>`__.


restriction
=============

**restriction**: n.

A `bug <../B/bug.html>`__ or design error that limits a program's
capabilities, and which is sufficiently egregious that nobody can quite
work up enough nerve to describe it as a
`feature <../F/feature.html>`__. Often used (esp. by
`marketroid <../M/marketroid.html>`__ types) to make it sound as
though some crippling bogosity had been intended by the designers all
along, or was forced upon them by arcane technical constraints of a
nature no mere user could possibly comprehend (these claims are almost
invariably false).

Old-time hacker Joseph M. Newcomer advises that whenever choosing a
quantifiable but arbitrary restriction, you should make it either a
power of 2 or a power of 2 minus 1. If you impose a limit of 107 items
in a list, everyone will know it is a random number — on the other hand,
a limit of 15 or 16 suggests some deep reason (involving 0- or 1-based
indexing in binary) and you will get less
`flamage <../F/flamage.html>`__ for it. Limits which are round numbers
in base 10 are always especially suspect.

 

retcon
=================
 

**retcon**: /ret´kon/

[short for ‘retroactive continuity’, from the Usenet newsgroup
``rec.arts.comics``]

1. n. The common situation in pulp fiction (esp. comics or soap operas)
where a new story ‘reveals’ things about events in previous stories,
usually leaving the ‘facts’ the same (thus preserving continuity) while
completely changing their interpretation. For example, revealing that a
whole season of *Dallas* was a dream was a retcon.

2. vt. To write such a story about a character or fictitious object.
“Byrne has retconned Superman's cape so that it is no longer
unbreakable.” “Marvelman's old adventures were retconned into synthetic
dreams.” “Swamp Thing was retconned from a transformed person into a
sentient vegetable.”

[This term is included because it is a good example of hackish
linguistic innovation in a field completely unrelated to computers. The
word retcon will probably spread through comics fandom and lose its
association with hackerdom within a couple of years; for the record, it
started here. —ESR]

[1993 update: some comics fans on the net now claim that retcon was
independently in use in comics fandom before ``rec.arts.comics``, and
have citations from around 1981. In lexicography, nothing is ever
simple. —ESR]

 

RETI
===============

 

**RETI**: v.

Syn. `RTI <RTI.html>`__

 

retrocomputing
=================

**retrocomputing**: /ret'·roh·k@m·pyoo´ting/, n.

Refers to emulations of way-behind-the-state-of-the-art hardware or
software, or implementations of never-was-state-of-the-art; esp. if such
implementations are elaborate practical jokes and/or parodies, written
mostly for `hack value <../H/hack-value.html>`__, of more ‘serious’
designs. Perhaps the most widely distributed retrocomputing utility was
the pnch(6) or bcd(6) program on V7 and other early Unix versions, which
would accept up to 80 characters of text argument and display the
corresponding pattern in `punched card <../P/punched-card.html>`__
code. Other well-known retrocomputing hacks have included the
programming language `INTERCAL <../I/INTERCAL.html>`__, a
`JCL <../J/JCL.html>`__-emulating shell for Unix, the
card-punch-emulating editor named 029, and various elaborate
`PDP-11 <../P/PDP-11.html>`__ hardware emulators and RT-11 OS
emulators written just to keep an old, sourceless
`Zork <../Z/Zork.html>`__ binary running.

A tasty selection of retrocomputing programs are made available at the
Retrocomputing Museum,
`http://www.catb.org/retro/ <http://www.catb.org/retro/>`__.


return from the dead
=======================

**return from the dead**: v.

To regain access to the net after a long absence. Compare `person of no
account <../P/person-of-no-account.html>`__.
 

RFC
====================
 

**RFC**: /R·F·C/, n.

[Request For Comment] One of a long-es­tab­lished series of numbered
Internet informational documents and standards widely followed by
commercial software and freeware in the Internet and Unix communities.
Perhaps the single most influential one has been RFC-822 (the Internet
mail-format standard). The RFCs are unusual in that they are floated by
technical experts acting on their own initiative and reviewed by the
Internet at large, rather than formally promulgated through an
institution such as ANSI. For this reason, they remain known as RFCs
even once adopted as standards.

The RFC tradition of pragmatic, experience-driven, after-the-fact
standard writing done by individuals or small working groups has
important advantages over the more formal, committee-driven process
typical of ANSI or ISO. Emblematic of some of these advantages is the
existence of a flourishing tradition of ‘joke’ RFCs; usually at least
one a year is published, usually on April 1st. Well-known joke RFCs have
included 527 (“ARPAWOCKY”, R. Merryman, UCSD; 22 June 1973), 748
(“Telnet Randomly-Lose Option”, Mark R. Crispin; 1 April 1978), and 1149
(“A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers”, D.
Waitzman, BBN STC; 1 April 1990). The first was a Lewis Carroll
pastiche; the second a parody of the TCP-IP documentation style, and the
third a deadpan skewering of standards-document legalese, describing
protocols for transmitting Internet data packets by carrier pigeon
(since actually implemented; see Appendix A). See also `Infinite-Monkey
Theorem <../I/Infinite-Monkey-Theorem.html>`__.

The RFCs are most remarkable for how well they work — they frequently
manage to have neither the ambiguities that are usually rife in informal
specifications, nor the committee-perpetrated misfeatures that often
haunt formal standards, and they define a network that has grown to
truly worldwide proportions.
 

RFE
================
 

**RFE**: /R·F·E/, n.

1. [techspeak] Request For Enhancement (compare `RFC <RFC.html>`__).

2. [from ‘Radio Free Europe’, Bellcore and Sun] Radio Free Ethernet, a
system (originated by Peter Langston) for broadcasting audio among Sun
SPARCstations over the ethernet.
 

Right Thing
================

**Right Thing**: n.

That which is *compellingly* the correct or appropriate thing to use,
do, say, etc. Often capitalized, always emphasized in speech as though
capitalized. Use of this term often implies that in fact reasonable
people may disagree. “What's the right thing for LISP to do when it sees
(mod a 0)? Should it return **a**, or give a divide-by-0 error?” Oppose
`Wrong Thing <../W/Wrong-Thing.html>`__.
 
rip
============== 

**rip**: v.

1. To extract the digital representation of a piece of music from an
audio CD. Software that does this is often called a “CD ripper”.

2. [Amiga hackers] To extract sound or graphics from a program that they
have been compiled/assembled into, or which generates them at run-time.
In the case of older Amiga games this entails searching through memory
shortly after a reboot. This sense has been in use for many years and
probably gave rise to the (now more common) sense 1.

 

ripoff
=======

**ripoff**: n.

Synonym for `chad <../C/chad.html>`__, sense 1.


RL
============

**RL**: //, n.

[MUD community] Real Life. “Firiss laughs in RL” means that Firiss's
player is laughing. Compare `meatspace <../M/meatspace.html>`__;
oppose `VR <../V/VR.html>`__.

 

roach
========

**roach**: vt.

[Bell Labs] To destroy, esp. of a data structure. Hardware gets
`toast <../T/toast.html>`__\ ed or `fried <../F/fried.html>`__,
software gets roached. Probably derived from '70s and '80s drug slang;
marijuana smokers used ‘roach’ to refer to the unsmokable remnant of a
joint, and to ‘roach’ a joint was therefore to destroy it.
 

robocanceller
===============

**robocanceller**: /roh·boh·kan´sel·@r/

A program that monitors Usenet feeds, attempting to detect and eliminate
`spam <../S/spam.html>`__ by sending appropriate cancel messages.
Robocancellers may use the `Breidbart
Index <../B/Breidbart-Index.html>`__ as a trigger. Programming them is
not a game for amateurs; see `ARMM <../A/ARMM.html>`__. See also
`Dave the Resurrector <../D/Dave-the-Resurrector.html>`__.

 

robot
========

**robot**: n.

See `bot <../B/bot.html>`__.
 

robust
==========

**robust**: adj.

Said of a system that has demonstrated an ability to recover gracefully
from the whole range of exceptional inputs and situations in a given
environment. One step below `bulletproof <../B/bulletproof.html>`__.
Carries the additional connotation of elegance in addition to just
careful attention to detail. Compare `smart <../S/smart.html>`__,
oppose `brittle <../B/brittle.html>`__.

 

rococo
=========

**rococo**: adj.

Terminally `baroque <../B/baroque.html>`__. Used to imply that a
program has become so encrusted with the software equivalent of gold
leaf and curlicues that they have completely swamped the underlying
design. Called after the later and more extreme forms of Baroque
architecture and decoration prevalent during the mid-1700s in Europe.
Alan Perlis said: “Every program eventually becomes rococo, and then
rubble.” Compare `critical mass <../C/critical-mass.html>`__.

 

rogue
===========

**rogue**

1. [Unix] n. A Dungeons-and-Dragons-like game using character graphics,
written under BSD Unix and subsequently ported to other Unix systems.
The original BSD curses(3) screen-handling package was hacked together
by Ken Arnold primarily to support games, and the development of
rogue(6) popularized its use; it has since become one of Unix's most
important and heavily used application libraries. Nethack, Omega, Larn,
Angband, and an entire subgenre of computer dungeon games (all known as
‘roguelikes’) all took off from the inspiration provided by rogue(6);
the popular Windows game Diablo, though graphics-intensive, has very
similar play logic. See also `nethack <../N/nethack.html>`__,
`moria <../M/moria.html>`__, `Angband <../A/Angband.html>`__.

2. [Usenet] adj. An `ISP <../I/ISP.html>`__ which permits net abuse
(usually in the form of `spam <../S/spam.html>`__\ ming) by its
customers, or which itself engages in such activities. Rogue ISPs are
sometimes subject to `IDP <../I/IDP.html>`__\ s or
`UDP <../U/UDP.html>`__\ s. Sometimes deliberately misspelled as
“rouge”.
 

room-temperature IQ
=====================

**room-temperature IQ**: quant.

[IBM] 80 or below (nominal room temperature is 72 degrees Fahrenheit, 22
degrees Celsius). Used in describing the expected intelligence range of
the `luser <../L/luser.html>`__. “Well, but how's this interface going
to play with the room-temperature IQ crowd?” See `drool-proof
paper <../D/drool-proof-paper.html>`__. This is a much more insulting
phrase in countries that use Celsius thermometers.

 

root
==========

**root**: n.

1. [Unix] The `superuser <../S/superuser.html>`__ account (with user
name ‘root’) that ignores permission bits, user number 0 on a Unix
system. The term `avatar <../A/avatar.html>`__ is also used.

2. The top node of the system directory structure; historically the home
directory of the root user, but probably named after the root of an
(inverted) tree.

3. By extension, the privileged system-maintenance login on any OS. See
`root mode <root-mode.html>`__, `go root <../G/go-root.html>`__, see
also `wheel <../W/wheel.html>`__.

 

rootkit
=========

**rootkit**: /root´kit/, n.

[very common] A kit for maintaining `root <root.html>`__; an automated
`cracking <../C/cracking.html>`__ tool. What `script
kiddies <../S/script-kiddies.html>`__ use. After a cracker has first
broken in and gained root access, he or she will install modified
binaries such as a modified version login with a backdoor, or a version
of ps that will not report the cracker's processes). This is a rootkit.
 

root mode
===========

**root mode**: n.

Syn. with `wizard mode <../W/wizard-mode.html>`__ or wheel mode. Like
these, it is often generalized to describe privileged states in systems
other than OSes.

 

rot13
=========
 

**rot13**: /rot ther´teen/, n.,v.

[Usenet: from ‘rotate alphabet 13 places’] The simple Caesar-cypher
encryption that replaces each English letter with the one 13 places
forward or back along the alphabet, so that “The butler did it!” becomes
“Gur ohgyre qvq vg!” Most Usenet news reading and posting programs
include a rot13 feature. It is used to enclose the text in a sealed
wrapper that the reader must choose to open — e.g., for posting things
that might offend some readers, or `spoiler <../S/spoiler.html>`__\ s.
A major advantage of rot13 over rot(\ ``N``) for other ``N`` is that it
is self-inverse, so the same code can be used for encoding and decoding.
See also `spoiler space <../S/spoiler-space.html>`__, which has partly
displaced rot13 since non-Unix-based newsreaders became common.

 

rotary debugger
=================

**rotary debugger**: n.

[Commodore] Essential equipment for those late-night or early-morning
debugging sessions. Mainly used as sustenance for the hacker. Comes in
many decorator colors, such as Sausage, Pepperoni, and Garbage. See
`ANSI standard pizza <../A/ANSI-standard-pizza.html>`__.

RSN
==========

**RSN**: /R·S·N/, adj.

See `Real Soon Now <Real-Soon-Now.html>`__.

 

RTBM
=======

**RTBM**: /R·T·B·M/, imp.

[Unix] Commonwealth Hackish variant of `RTFM <RTFM.html>`__; expands
to ‘Read The Bloody Manual’. RTBM is often the entire text of the first
reply to a question from a `newbie <../N/newbie.html>`__; the *second*
would escalate to “RTFM”.

RTFAQ
===========
 

**RTFAQ**: /R·T·F·A·Q/, imp.

[Usenet: primarily written, by analogy with `RTFM <RTFM.html>`__]
Abbrev. for ‘Read the FAQ!’, an exhortation that the person addressed
ought to read the newsgroup's `FAQ list <../F/FAQ-list.html>`__ before
posting questions.

RTFB
=============
 

**RTFB**: /R·T·F·B/, imp.

[Unix] Abbreviation for ‘Read The Fucking Binary’. Used when neither
documentation nor source for the problem at hand exists, and the only
thing to do is use some debugger or monitor and directly analyze the
assembler or even the machine code. “No source for the buggy port
driver? Aaargh! I *hate* proprietary operating systems. Time to RTFB.”

Of the various RTF? forms, ‘RTFB’ is the least pejorative against anyone
asking a question for which RTFB is the answer; the anger here is
directed at the absence of both source *and* adequate documentation.

 

RTFM
=========

**RTFM**: /R·T·F·M/, imp.

[Unix] Abbreviation for ‘Read The Fucking Manual’.

1. Used by `guru <../G/guru.html>`__\ s to brush off questions they
consider trivial or annoying. Compare `Don't do that
then! <../D/Don-t-do-that-then-.html>`__.

2. Used when reporting a problem to indicate that you aren't just asking
out of `randomness <randomness.html>`__. “No, I can't figure out how
to interface Unix to my toaster, and yes, I have RTFM.” Unlike sense 1,
this use is considered polite. See also `FM <../F/FM.html>`__,
`RTFAQ <RTFAQ.html>`__, `RTFB <RTFB.html>`__,
`RTFS <RTFS.html>`__, `STFW <../S/STFW.html>`__,
`RTM <RTM.html>`__, all of which mutated from RTFM, and compare
`UTSL <../U/UTSL.html>`__.

 
RTFS
=======

**RTFS**: /R·T·F·S/

[Unix]

1. imp. Abbreviation for ‘Read The Fucking Source’. Variant form of
`RTFM <RTFM.html>`__, used when the problem at hand is not necessarily
obvious and not answerable from the manuals — or the manuals are not yet
written and maybe never will be. For even trickier situations, see
`RTFB <RTFB.html>`__. Unlike RTFM, the anger inherent in RTFS is not
usually directed at the person asking the question, but rather at the
people who failed to provide adequate documentation.

2. imp. ‘Read The Fucking Standard’; this oath can only be used when the
problem area (e.g., a language or operating system interface) has
actually been codified in a ratified standards document. The existence
of these standards documents (and the technically inappropriate but
politically mandated compromises that they inevitably contain, and the
impenetrable `legalese <../L/legalese.html>`__ in which they are
invariably written, and the unbelievably tedious bureaucratic process by
which they are produced) can be unnerving to hackers, who are used to a
certain amount of ambiguity in the specifications of the systems they
use. (Hackers feel that such ambiguities are acceptable as long as the
`Right Thing <Right-Thing.html>`__ to do is obvious to any thinking
observer; sadly, this casual attitude towards specifications becomes
unworkable when a system becomes popular in the `Real
World <Real-World.html>`__.) Since a hacker is likely to feel that a
standards document is both unnecessary and technically deficient, the
deprecation inherent in this term may be directed as much against the
standard as against the person who ought to read it.

RTI
=========

**RTI**: /R·T·I/, interj.

The mnemonic for the ‘return from interrupt’ instruction on many
computers including the 6502 and 6800. The variant RETI is found among
Z80 hackers. Equivalent to “Now, where was I?” or used to end a
conversational digression. See `pop <../P/pop.html>`__.
 
RTM
 

**RTM**: /R·T·M/

1. [Usenet: abbreviation for ‘Read The Manual’] Politer variant of
`RTFM <RTFM.html>`__.

2. Robert Tappan Morris, perpetrator of the great Internet worm of 1988
(see `Great Worm <../G/Great-Worm.html>`__); villain to many, naive
hacker gone wrong to a few. Morris claimed that the worm that brought
the Internet to its knees was a benign experiment that got out of
control as the result of a coding error. After the storm of negative
publicity that followed this blunder, Morris's username on ITS was
hacked from RTM to `RTFM <RTFM.html>`__.

 
RTS
===============

**RTS**: /R·T·S/, imp.

Abbreviation for ‘Read The Screen’. Mainly used by hackers in the
microcomputer world. Refers to what one would like to tell the
`suit <../S/suit.html>`__ one is forced to explain an extremely simple
application to. Particularly appropriate when the suit failed to notice
the ‘Press any key to continue’ prompt, and wishes to know ‘why won't it
do anything’. Also seen as ‘RTFS’ in especially deserving cases.

 

rubber-hose cryptanalysis
==============================

**rubber-hose cryptanalysis**: n.

[sci.crypt newsgroup] The technique of breaking a code or cipher by
finding someone who has the key and applying a rubber hose vigorously
and repeatedly to the soles of that luckless person's feet until the key
is discovered. Shorthand for any method of coercion: the originator of
the term drily noted that it “can take a surprisingly short time and is
quite computationally inexpensive” relative to other cryptanalysis
methods. Compare `social
engineering <../S/social-engineering.html>`__, `brute
force <../B/brute-force.html>`__.

rude
=====================

**rude**: adj.

1. (of a program) Badly written.

2. Functionally poor, e.g., a program that is very difficult to use
because of gratuitously poor (random?) design decisions. Oppose
`cuspy <../C/cuspy.html>`__.

3. Anything that manipulates a shared resource without regard for its
other users in such a way as to cause a (non-fatal) problem. Examples:
programs that change tty modes without resetting them on exit, or
windowing programs that keep forcing themselves to the top of the window
stack.
 

runes
================

**runes**: pl.n.

1. Anything that requires `heavy
wizardry <../H/heavy-wizardry.html>`__ or `black
art <../B/black-art.html>`__ to `parse <../P/parse.html>`__: core
dumps, JCL commands, APL, or code in a language you haven't a clue how
to read. Not quite as bad as `line noise <../L/line-noise.html>`__,
but close. Compare `casting the
runes <../C/casting-the-runes.html>`__, `Great
Runes <../G/Great-Runes.html>`__.

2. Special display characters (for example, the high-half graphics on an
IBM PC).

3. [borderline techspeak] 16-bit characters from the Unicode
multilingual character set.
 

runic
=================

**runic**: adj.

Syn. `obscure <../O/obscure.html>`__. VMS fans sometimes refer to Unix
as ‘Runix’; Unix fans return the compliment by expanding VMS to ‘Very
Messy Syntax’ or ‘Vachement Mauvais Système’ (French idiom, “Hugely Bad
System”).
 

rusty iron
================

**rusty iron**: n.

Syn. `tired iron <../T/tired-iron.html>`__. It has been claimed that
this is the inevitable fate of `water MIPS <../W/water-MIPS.html>`__.

 

rusty wire
==================

**rusty wire**: n.

[Amateur Packet Radio] Any very noisy network medium, in which the
packets are subject to frequent corruption. Most prevalent in reference
to wireless links subject to all the vagaries of RF noise and marginal
propagation conditions. “Yes, but how good is your whizbang new protocol
on really rusty wire?”.
