**jack in**: v.

To log on to a machine or connect to a network or
`BBS <./B.html#BBS.html>`__, esp. for purposes of entering a `virtual
reality <./V.html#virtual-reality.html>`__ simulation such as a
`MUD <./M.html#MUD.html>`__ or `IRC <./I.html#IRC.html>`__ (leaving is
“jacking out”). This term derives from
`cyberpunk <./C.html#cyberpunk.html>`__ SF, in which it was used for the
act of plugging an electrode set into neural sockets in order to
interface the brain directly to a virtual reality. It is primarily used
by MUD and IRC fans and younger hackers on BBS systems.

**Java**

An object-oriented language originally developed at Sun by James Gosling
(and known by the name “Oak”) with the intention of being the successor
to `C++ <./C.html#C-plus-plus.html>`__ (the project was however originally
sold to Sun as an embedded language for use in set-top boxes). After the
great Internet explosion of 1993-1994, Java was hacked into a
byte-interpreted language and became the focus of a relentless hype
campaign by Sun, which touted it as the new language of choice for
distributed applications.

Java is indeed a stronger and cleaner design than C++ and has been
embraced by many in the hacker community — but it has been a
considerable source of frustration to many others, for reasons ranging
from uneven support on different Web browser platforms, performance
issues, and some notorious deficiencies in some of the standard toolkits
(AWT in particular). `Microsoft <./M.html#Microsoft.html>`__'s determined
attempts to corrupt the language (which it rightly sees as a threat to
its OS monopoly) have not helped. As of 2003, these issues are still in
the process of being resolved.

Despite many attractive features and a good design, it is difficult to
find people willing to praise Java who have tried to implement a
complex, real-world system with it (but to be fair it is early days yet,
and no other language has ever been forced to spend its childhood under
the limelight the way Java has). On the other hand, Java has already
been a big `win <./W.html#win.html>`__ in academic circles, where it has
taken the place of `Pascal <./P.html#Pascal.html>`__ as the preferred tool
for teaching the basics of good programming to the next generation of
hackers.

**JCL**: /J·C·L/, n.

1. IBM's supremely `rude <./R.html#rude.html>`__ Job Control Language. JCL
is the script language used to control the execution of programs in
IBM's batch systems. JCL has a very `fascist <./F.html#fascist.html>`__
syntax, and some versions will, for example, `barf <./B.html#barf.html>`__
if two spaces appear where it expects one. Most programmers confronted
with JCL simply copy a working file (or card deck), changing the file
names. Someone who actually understands and generates unique JCL is
regarded with the mixed respect one gives to someone who memorizes the
phone book. It is reported that hackers at IBM itself sometimes sing
“Who's the breeder of the crud that mangles you and me? I-B-M, J-C-L,
M-o-u-s-e” to the tune of the *Mickey Mouse Club* theme to express their
opinion of the beast.

2. A comparative for any very `rude <./R.html#rude.html>`__ software that
a hacker is expected to use. “That's as bad as JCL.” As with
`COBOL <./C.html#COBOL.html>`__, JCL is often used as an archetype of
ugliness even by those who haven't experienced it. See also
`IBM <./I.html#IBM.html>`__, `fear and
loathing <./F.html#fear-and-loathing.html>`__.

A (poorly documented, naturally) shell simulating JCL syntax is
available at the Retrocomputing Museum
`http://www.catb.org/retro/ <http://www.catb.org/retro/>`__.

**JEDR**: //, n.

Synonymous with `IYFEG <./I.html#IYFEG.html>`__. At one time, people in
the Usenet newsgroup "rec.humor.funny" tended to use ‘JEDR’ instead of
`IYFEG <./I.html#IYFEG.html>`__ or ‘<ethnic>’; this stemmed from a public
attempt to suppress the group once made by a loser with initials JEDR
after he was offended by an ethnic joke posted there. (The practice was
`retcon <./R.html#retcon.html>`__\ ned by expanding these initials as
‘Joke Ethnic/Denomination/Race’.) After much sound and fury JEDR faded
away; this term appears to be doing likewise. JEDR's only permanent
effect on the net.culture was to discredit ‘sensitivity’ arguments for
censorship so thoroughly that more recent attempts to raise them have
met with immediate and near-universal rejection.

**Jeff K.**

The spiritual successor to `B1FF <./B.html#B1FF.html>`__ and the archetype
of `script kiddies <./S.html#script-kiddies.html>`__. Jeff K. is a
sixteen-year-old suburbanite who fancies himself a “l33t haX0r”,
although his knowledge of computers seems to be limited to the procedure
for getting Quake up and running. His Web page
`http://www.somethingawful.com/jeffk/ <http://www.somethingawful.com/jeffk/>`__
features a number of hopelessly naive articles, essays, and rants, all
filled with the kind of misspellings,
`studlycaps <./S.html#studlycaps.html>`__, and number-for-letter
substitutions endemic to the script kiddie and `warez
d00dz <./W.html#warez-d00dz.html>`__ communities. Jeff's offerings, among
other things, include hardware advice (such as “AMD VERSIS PENTIUM” and
“HOW TO OVARCLOAK YOUR COMPUTAR”), his own Quake clan (Clan 40 OUNSCE),
and his own comic strip (Wacky Fun Computar Comic Jokes).

Like B1FF, Jeff K. is (fortunately) a hoax. Jeff K. was created by
internet game journalist Richard “Lowtax” Kyanka, whose web site
Something Awful (http://www.somethingawful.com) highlights
unintentionally humorous news items and Web sites, as a parody of the
kind of teenage `luser <./L.html#luser.html>`__ who infests Quake servers,
chat rooms, and other places where computer enthusiasts congregate. He
is well-recognized in the PC game community and his influence has spread
to hacker `fora <./F.html#fora.html>`__ like Slashdot as well.

jiffy

J

 `Next <job-security.html>`__

 

**jiffy**: n.

1. The duration of one tick of the system clock on your computer (see
`tick <./T.html#tick.html>`__). Often one AC cycle time (1/60 second in
the U.S. and Canada, 1/50 most other places), but more recently 1/100
sec has become common. “The swapper runs every 6 jiffies” means that the
virtual memory management routine is executed once for every 6 ticks of
the clock, or about ten times a second.

2. Confusingly, the term is sometimes also used for a 1-millisecond
`wall time <./W.html#wall-time.html>`__ interval.

3. Even more confusingly, physicists semi-jokingly use ‘jiffy’ to mean
the time required for light to travel one foot in a vacuum, which turns
out to be close to one *nanosecond*. Other physicists use the term for
the quantum-nechanical lower bound on meaningful time lengths,

4. Indeterminate time from a few seconds to forever. “I'll do it in a
jiffy” means certainly not now and possibly never. This is a bit
contrary to the more widespread use of the word. Oppose
`nano <./N.html#nano.html>`__. See also `Real Soon
Now <./R.html#Real-Soon-Now.html>`__.

**job security**: n.

When some piece of code is written in a particularly
`obscure <./O.html#obscure.html>`__ fashion, and no good reason (such as
time or space optimization) can be discovered, it is often said that the
programmer was attempting to increase his job security (i.e., by making
himself indispensable for maintenance). This sour joke seldom has to be
said in full; if two hackers are looking over some code together and one
points at a section and says “job security”, the other one may just nod.

“\ `Perl <./P.html#Perl.html>`__ may be a handy program, but if you look
at the source, it's complete joe code.”

2. Badly written, possibly buggy code.

Correspondents wishing to remain anonymous have fingered a particular
Joe at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and observed that usage has
drifted slightly; the original sobriquet ‘Joe code’ was intended in
sense 1.

1994 update: This term has now generalized to ‘<name> code’, used to
designate code with distinct characteristics traceable to its author.
“This section doesn't check for a NULL return from malloc()! Oh. No
wonder! It's Ed code!”. Used most often with a programmer who has left
the shop and thus is a convenient scapegoat for anything that is wrong
with the project.

going back to MIT in the 1960s. See `random <./R.html#random.html>`__,
`Suzie COBOL <./S.html#Suzie-COBOL.html>`__. This may originally have been
inspired by ‘J. Fred Muggs’, a show-biz chimpanzee whose name was a

Keeping a lot of `state <./S.html#state.html>`__ in your head while

In the classic 1975 first-contact SF novel *The Mote in God's Eye*, by
Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, an alien describes a very difficult
task by saying “We juggle priceless eggs in variable gravity.” It is
possible that this was intended as tribute to a less colorful use of the
same image in Robert Heinlein's influential 1961 novel *Stranger in a
