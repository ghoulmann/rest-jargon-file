**ill-behaved**: adj.

1. [numerical analysis] Said of an algorithm or computational method
that tends to blow up because of accumulated roundoff error or poor
convergence properties.

2. [obs.] Software that bypasses the defined `*OS* <../O/OS.html>`__
interfaces to do things (like screen, keyboard, and disk I/O) itself,
often in a way that depends on the hardware of the machine it is running
on or which is nonportable or incompatible with other pieces of
software. In the MS-DOS world, there was a folk theorem (nearly true) to
the effect that (owing to gross inadequacies and performance penalties
in the OS interface) all interesting applications were ill-behaved. See
also `*bare metal* <../B/bare-metal.html>`__. Oppose
`*well-behaved* <../W/well-behaved.html>`__. See also
`*mess-dos* <../M/mess-dos.html>`__.

3. In modern usage, a program is called ill-behaved if it uses
interfaces to the OS or other programs that are private, undocumented,
or grossly non-portable. Another way to be ill-behaved is to use headers
or files that are theoretically private to another application.
